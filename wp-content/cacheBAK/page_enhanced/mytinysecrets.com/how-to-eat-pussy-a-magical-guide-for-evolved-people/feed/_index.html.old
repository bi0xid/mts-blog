		<description><![CDATA[I really love eating out my gf, she tastes amazing and looks amazing and that works much better for her than just sex. But recently she read somewhere that HSV-1 which is a cold sores most of us have can turn into genital herpes on her vagina if I give oral sex to her even if I don&#039;t have actual sores on my lips. And it can later affect pregnancy in a bad way. It sounds like nonsense as 65-90% of the world population have HSV-1 virus and lots of them lick their girls and I don&#039;t think it causes problems to anyone as soon as you don&#039;t do it when you have an actual sores outbreak on your lips. But she&#039;s determined about it and now I can&#039;t do nothing with her pussy and anal area too. That is so lame, I miss it so much. And simple sex doesn&#039;t get off neither her, nor me. :/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let him know how you feel. If he cares about you, he will want to do everything possible to maximize your enjoyment. Just as no two women will have the exact same time to orgasm (hopefully achieved), not all men will have the same time to finish. I am average size, with an average build - but I need a minimum of 15-20 minutes and can last over an hour before finishing if my GF wants to keep going. Again, let him know how you feel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true vaginas clean themselves (we have two organs that clean themselves: vagina and the eyes), but many women don&#039;t wash the outside part properly or daily. I use vaginal feminine wash for down there and never wash it with body wash or soap. It makes a huge difference, keeps it cleaner and smells better for longer hours. I always wash before I&#039;m with a man, it takes 30sec to just wash down there while on the toilet. If the outside smells like fish, it&#039;s not because any weird bacteria, it&#039;s the moist that makes the outside part a bit smelly 6-8h after the shower. All pussies smell of fish if not washed for 8hours. If it smells really really bad than it might be a bacteria or the woman might not have washed her VJ  for over 36h, which it&#039;s gross. Blake, sounds like you are picking cheap, low class women if 70%of them taste disgusting. Sounds like you are desperate for pussies. This makes you less desirable to girls like me and others that are super clean and as a result taste pretty good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hold up. I just wanna say that your gspot wasn&#039;t moved from child birth. As soon as you said he was asian I knew it was because asian men have small penis. It&#039;s true. The ones I&#039;ve been with had small penis as well. Our gspots are close like 3-4 inchs inside of us. I usually have my boyfriend stick just the head in, or when he fingers me when I use my toy makes me cum every time. He has a huge dick so I like it when he sticks just the head in. Its because of our gspots being not that far in. So the fact that he had a small penis made you cum, love. Lol]]></description>
