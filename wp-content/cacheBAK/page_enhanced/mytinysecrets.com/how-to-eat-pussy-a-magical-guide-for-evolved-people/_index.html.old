<p>Hey, I have a lot of respect for all you guys who like to eat pussy because there are too few of you out there. And I&#8217;m not the only woman who says this. Furthermore, some of you guys who are giving it the old college try are not doing too well, so maybe this little lesson will help you out.</p>
<p>When a woman finds a man who gives good head, she&#8217;s found a treasure she&#8217;s not going to let go of too quickly. This is one rare customer and she knows it. She won&#8217;t even tell her girlfriends about it or that guy will become the most popular man in town. So, remember, most guys can fuck, and those who can usually do it satisfactorily, <a title="Confessions Of A Sensitive Pussy: How To Give Her Earth-Shattering Cunnilingus" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/confessions-of-a-sensitive-pussy-how-to-give-her-earth-shattering-cunnilingus/">but the guy who gives good head</a>, he&#8217;s got it made.</p>
<h2>The Pussy-Licking-Guide for evolved people in 15 magical steps</h2>
<h4>#1: Tell her she is beautiful and mean it.</h4>
<p>Most women are shy about their bodies. Even if you&#8217;ve got the world&#8217;s most gorgeous woman in bed with you, she&#8217;s going to worry about how you like her body. Tell her it&#8217;s beautiful, tell her which parts you like best, tell her anything, but get her to trust you enough to let you down between her legs.</p>
<h4>#2 Stop and appreciate her unique flower</h4>
<p>Now stop and look at what you see. Beautiful, isn&#8217;t it? There is nothing that makes a woman more unique than her pussy. I know. I&#8217;ve seen plenty of them. They come in all different sizes, colors and shapes; some are tucked inside like a little girl&#8217;s cunnie and some have thick luscious lips that come out to greet you. Some are nested in brushes of fur and others are covered with transparent fuzz. Appreciate your woman&#8217;s unique qualities and tell her what makes her special.</p>
<h4>#3 Women are more verbal: Talk to her beautiful pussy</h4>
<p>Women are a good deal more verbal than men, especially during love-making. They also respond more to verbal love, which means, the more you talk to her, the easier it will be to get her off. So all the time you&#8217;re petting and stroking her beautiful pussy, talk to her about it.</p>
<h4>#4 Lick her outer lips, inner lips and find her clit</h4>
<p>Now look at it again. Gently pull the lips apart and look at her inner lips, even lick them if you want to. Now spread the tops of her pussy up until you can find her clit. Women have clits in all different sizes, just like you guys have different sized cocks. It doesn&#8217;t mean a thing as far as her capacity for orgasm. All it means is more of her is hidden underneath her foreskin.</p>
<h4>#5 Whenever you touch a woman&#8217;s pussy, make sure your finger is wet</h4>
<p>Whenever you touch a woman&#8217;s pussy, make sure your finger is wet. You can lick it or moisten it with juices from inside her. Be sure, by all means, to wet it before you touch her clit because it doesn&#8217;t have any juices of it&#8217;s own and it&#8217;s extremely sensitive. Your finger will stick to it if it&#8217;s dry and that hurts. But you don&#8217;t want to touch her clit anyway. You have to work up to that. Before she becomes aroused, her clit is too delicate to be handled.</p>
<h4>#6 Tease her &amp; approach her pussy slowly</h4>
<p>Approach her <a title="Slow Pussy Sucking (Only For Grown Folks)" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/slow-pussy-sucking-only-for-grown-folks/">pussy slowly</a>. Women, even more so than men, love to be teased. The inner part of her thigh is her most tender spot. Lick it, kiss it, make designs on it with the tip of your tongue. Come dangerously close to her pussy, then float away. Make her anticipate it.</p>
<h4>#7 Play with her</h4>
<p>Now lick the crease where her leg joins her pussy. Nuzzle your face into her bush. Brush your lips over her slit without pressing down on it to further excite her. After you&#8217;ve done this to the point where your lady is bucking up from her seat and she&#8217;s straining to get more of you closer to her, then put your lips right on top of her slit.</p>
<h4>#8 Kiss her, gently, then harder</h4>
<p>Kiss her, gently, then harder. Now use your tongue to separate her pussy lips and when she opens up, run your tongue up and down between the layers of pussy flesh. Gently spread her legs more with your hands. Everything you do with a woman you&#8217;re about to eat must be done gently.</p>
<h4>#9 Tongue-fuck her</h4>
<p>Tongue-fuck her. This feels divine. It also teases the hell out of her because by now she wants some attention given to her clit. Check it out. See if her clit has gotten hard enough to peek out of it&#8217;s covering. If so, lick it. If you can&#8217;t see it, it might still be waiting for you underneath. So bring your tongue up the top of her slit and feel for her clit. You may barely experience it&#8217;s presence. But even if you can&#8217;t feel the tiny pearl, you can make it rise by licking the skin that covers it. Lick hard now and press into her skin.</p>
<h4>#10 Work her tip of the iceberg</h4>
<p>Gently pull the pussy lips away and flick your tongue against the clit, hood covered or not. Do this quickly. This should cause her legs to shudder. When you sense she&#8217;s getting up there toward orgasm, make your lips into an O and take the clit into your mouth.</p>
<blockquote>
<h6>Start to suck gently and watch your lady&#8217;s face for her reaction. If she can handle it, begin to suck harder. If she digs it, suck even harder. Go with her. If she lifts her pelvis into the air with the tension of her rising orgasm, move with her, don&#8217;t fight her. Hang on, and keep your hot mouth on her clit. Don&#8217;t let go. That&#8217;s what she&#8217;ll be saying too: &#8216;Don&#8217;t stop. Don&#8217;t ever stop!&#8217;</h6>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason for that, most men stop too soon. Just like with cock sucking, this is something worth learning about and worth learning to do well. I know a man who&#8217;s a lousy fuck, simply lousy, but he can eat pussy like nobody I know and he never has trouble getting a date. Girls are falling all over him.</p>
<h4>#11 Finger-fuck her with TWO fingers</h4>
<p>But back to your pussy eating session&#8230;There&#8217;s another thing you can do to intensify your woman&#8217;s pleasure. You can finger-fuck her while she&#8217;s enjoying your clit-licking talents. Before, during or after. She&#8217;ll really like it. In addition to the erogenous zones surrounding her clit, a woman has another extremely sensitive area at the roof of her vagina. This is what you rub up against when you&#8217;re fucking her. Well, since your cock is pretty far away from your mouth, your fingers will have to do the fucking.</p>
<blockquote>
<h6>Take two fingers. One is too skinny and three is too wide and therefore can&#8217;t get deep enough. Make sure they&#8217;re wet so you don&#8217;t irritate her skin. Slide them inside, slowly at first, then a little faster. Fuck her with them rhythmically. Speed up only when she does. Listen to her breathing.</h6>
</blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;ll let you know what to do. If you&#8217;re sucking her clit and finger-fucking her at the same time, you&#8217;re giving her far more stimulation than you would be giving her with your cock alone. So you can count on it that she&#8217;s getting high on this. If there&#8217;s any doubt, check her out for symptoms.</p>
<h4>#12 Get to know her orgasmic symptoms to become even better</h4>
<p>Each woman is unique.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have one who&#8217;s nipples get hard when she&#8217;s excited</li>
<li>or only when she&#8217;s having an orgasm.</li>
<li>Your girl might flush red or</li>
<li>begin to tremble.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get to know her symptoms and you&#8217;ll be a more sensitive lover.</p>
<h4>#13 Don&#8217;t let go of her clit when she starts to orgasm &#8211; The Multi-Orgasmic Woman</h4>
<p>When she starts to have an orgasm, for heaven&#8217;s sakes, don&#8217;t let go of that clit. Hang in there for the duration. When she starts to come down from the first orgasm, press your tongue along the underside of the clit, leaving your lips covering the top. Move your tongue in and out of her cunt. If your fingers are inside, move them a little too, gently though, things are extremely sensitive just now.</p>
<blockquote>
<h6>If you play your cards right, you&#8217;ll get some multiple orgasms this way. A woman stays excited for a full hour after she&#8217;s had an orgasm. Do you realize the full impact of that information? The potential? One woman was clocked at 56 orgasms at one sitting. Do you know what effect you would have on <a title="The Sacred Purpose Of Orgasm" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-sacred-purpose-of-orgasm/">a woman you gave 56 orgasms</a> to? She&#8217;d be yours as long as you wanted her.</h6>
</blockquote>
<h4>#14 The cherry on the cake</h4>
<p>Some women like to have their man rub and enter their anal section with their finger while they are being eaten out!</p>
<h4>#15 After the orgasmic wave: Keep making love to her quietly</h4>
<p>The last advice I have for you is this:</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve made her come, made her your slave by giving her the best head she&#8217;s ever had, don&#8217;t leave her alone just yet. Talk to her, stroke her body, caress her breasts. Keep making love to her quietly until she&#8217;s come all the way down. A man can get off and go to sleep in the same breath and feel no remorse, no sense of loss. But a woman by nature requires some sensitivity from her lover in those first few moments after sex.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Oral sex can be the most exciting sexual experiences you can have. But it&#8217;s what you make it. Take your time, practice often, pay attention to your lover&#8217;s signals, and most of all, enjoy yourself.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now get to it and make your partner smile and love you forever!</p>
<p>With Love,<br />
Tammy, Linda and Nicole</p>

But recently she read somewhere that HSV-1 which is a cold sores most of us have can turn into genital herpes on her vagina if I give oral sex to her even if I don&#8217;t have actual sores on my lips. And it can later affect pregnancy in a bad way. It sounds like nonsense as 65-90% of the world population have HSV-1 virus and lots of them lick their girls and I don&#8217;t think it causes problems to anyone as soon as you don&#8217;t do it when you have an actual sores outbreak on your lips. But she&#8217;s determined about it and now I can&#8217;t do nothing with her pussy and anal area too. That is so lame, I miss it so much. And simple sex doesn&#8217;t get off neither her, nor me. :/</p>

My husband is great at oral sex. The best I have ever had was one time he put together a lot of items in this article.<br />
He ate my pussy on dog style, which I have never experienced before. He started licking my lips and his tongue felt like velvet against my skin. It was so warm and smooth. Then, he moved to the clit and started massaging it using the tip of his tongue. It was gentle and consistent, which made me warm up quickly. Before I realized, he was tongue-fucking me, and yes, it felt divine! It was unexpected, it made me feel empowered knowing he wanted me that much. He quickly moved back to the clit, sucking it while alternating the pressure. I started moving my hips back and forth while he sucked me, which made everything move to a whole new level. At that moment, I surrendered. I was his, he was in charge, and my mind was 100% at the moment. I was giving him my body and he was my master.<br />
After that, everything was a blur. I had multiple orgasms and he licked my juices every single time. I was making loud, animal sounds and didn&#8217;t care. It was my body&#8217;s response to that amount of pleasure I was given. We finished with penetration and he came like the God he is.<br />
I was still breathing heavily, in a daze. We sat in front of each other, my legs wrapped around him. I put my head against his chest, he kisses the top of my head and tells me how much he loves me. Voila! The perfect ending to the best fuck of my life.</p>

Just as no two women will have the exact same time to orgasm (hopefully achieved), not all men will have the same time to finish. I am average size, with an average build &#8211; but I need a minimum of 15-20 minutes and can last over an hour before finishing if my GF wants to keep going. Again, let him know how you feel.</p>

Throw me on the bed after you ripped off my clothes and lick my nipples.<br />
Rip off my pants and spread my legs.<br />
Fingers can go anywhere, but tongue stays on clit.<br />
Dont leave the clit. dont &#8220;tongue fuck&#8221; ugh, childs play.<br />

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3638" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ok, so I have been sexually active since I was 14 years old. My boyfriend and I had sex at least 100-150 times and I could never orgasm. Fast forward to age 16 I have a relationship that lasts 4 years and not once in those 4 years did I orgasm &#8211; I was so frazzled and sexually frustrated by that point that we went a solid 3 months without sex and he found it elsewhere. Unbeknownst of that I had his baby and I strongly suspect giving birth moved my g spot making it easier to get to. I met an asian man in his mid 20&#8217;s in a bar who was the funniest, smoothest talker no hint of an accent, he bought the nicest cocktails on the menu and being shy I was shocked at how easily I could chat to him. We went to his hotel with the permission of my friends and had a bubble bath together, then he massaged my back with oil while I was on the bed and started kissing my thighs while I was still on my belly, slowly moving up to my vagina. Then he turned me over and kissed my chest and belly all while still talking occasionally so there wasn&#8217;t awkward silence. I was soo relaxed when he started to give me the most amazing head. He did have a very small penis so he closed my thighs and inserted it while grinding our hips together (with a condom, I didn&#8217;t have to ask unlike with other guys) and by then he hadn&#8217;t fingered me which usually causes me to dry up and I just don&#8217;t like it so I was so wet I hadn&#8217;t been this wet since my first few times I&#8217;d ever had sex. When I had my very first orgasm I was in a haze afterwards and I was so happy/relaxed. I still get a sigh of relief at having met him and slight envy at women who get to have that regularly. As my ex of 4 years preferred to be submissive in the bed I in turn would like to be dominated next time around so I can definitely agree with the part about becoming the sex slave of the man who can give me great head and make me orgasm. I just have no idea what he&#8217;s going to look like.</p>

As soon as you said he was asian I knew it was because asian men have small penis. It&#8217;s true. The ones I&#8217;ve been with had small penis as well. Our gspots are close like 3-4 inchs inside of us. I usually have my boyfriend stick just the head in, or when he fingers me when I use my toy makes me cum every time. He has a huge dick so I like it when he sticks just the head in. Its because of our gspots being not that far in. So the fact that he had a small penis made you cum, love. Lol</p>

<p>How about an article on explaining to women how to clean your v-jay-jay properly so us men might feel more comfortable engulfing our faces in them??? Don&#8217;t expect us to get creative if you smell and taste like a fish market at the end of a warm day.</p>

Sorry to shoot you down mate, but just because it doesn&#8217;t smell like roses does not mean it isn&#8217;t clean. Just because her vagina smells does not make her some vile disgusting being. Vaginas are self-cleansing and they constantly ooze discharge to keep themselves clean inside. It&#8217;s healthy and perfectly natural for this to happen. Plenty of women have gotten extremely ill trying to douche their vaginas with water or worse to clean them under the assumption they aren&#8217;t clean. It&#8217;s bullshit, plain and simple.<br />
 If you&#8217;re in the heat of a moment and your fella pushes you down on the bed ready to eat you out the last thing you really want to think about or say to him is &#8220;Sorry, just let me go clean my vagina for any discharge before you eat me out&#8221;, mainly because people have the misconception that a vagina is just like the ones in porn, perfectly shaven and glistening clean.<br />
As an uncircumcised guy I get nasty stuff occasionally build-up under my foreskin that I&#8217;m sure a girl wouldn&#8217;t want to put in her mouth. This doesn&#8217;t make me some vile disgusting being because it can happen in a very short space of time. I don&#8217;t wash my dick every few hours on the off-chance that I&#8217;ll get lucky. I wouldn&#8217;t expect anyone to assume I&#8217;m disgusting because of it.<br />
It&#8217;s just natural. At the end of the day there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it and people should not feel bad about it. How would you feel on the flip-side if a girl said your dick tasted disgusting and needed washing? It&#8217;s harsh. People should try to be more understanding about these things and not so ignorant. If things like this bother you just politely talk to your partner and nicely tell them you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re disgusting or anything, but you&#8217;d appreciate it if they cleaned up a little before you give them oral.</p>

If that tone/attitude is at all evident when you are with real live women, not just throwing out sad generalizations about their genitals from the safety of your computer screen, then you will certainly encounter more of the same in your future; rather than the delicious treats most of the rest of the men, and women, in these comments are enjoying.</p>

I use vaginal feminine wash for down there and never wash it with body wash or soap. It makes a huge difference, keeps it cleaner and smells better for longer hours. I always wash before I&#8217;m with a man, it takes 30sec to just wash down there while on the toilet. If the outside smells like fish, it&#8217;s not because any weird bacteria, it&#8217;s the moist that makes the outside part a bit smelly 6-8h after the shower. All pussies smell of fish if not washed for 8hours. If it smells really really bad than it might be a bacteria or the woman might not have washed her VJ  for over 36h, which it&#8217;s gross. Blake, sounds like you are picking cheap, low class women if 70%of them taste disgusting. Sounds like you are desperate for pussies. This makes you less desirable to girls like me and others that are super clean and as a result taste pretty good.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3611" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>While the steps in this are for the most part accurate and all, I do take some major issues with this article too:</p>
<p>1)Objectification &#8211; saying that if a guy gives good head will mean women will not be able to resist him implies that women have almost no capacity for complex thought which is obviously wrong (and if anyone takes issue with this, be ready to learn some very hard lessons in life from some very strong women).<br />
2) Rape culture &#8211; Yeah, I know this is being talked about but for good reason. The conversation posted by Milan below points to the major issues in how women are viewed as objects and not humans. This objectification pointed to above, and perpetuated by saying things like &#8220;she will be your slave&#8221; &#8220;she will not be able to resist&#8221; etc., will make rape more common if people do not realize how wrong it is. What I am trying to get at is that if a woman turns down someone, maybe even someone she is already dating, and they think that they have some right to get sex from her because she has previously consented or because she &#8220;will not be able to resist&#8221; then it leaves room for rape to happen. Rule of thumb: if she says no, it doesn&#8217;t matter if she had consented before, it means no and you are committing rape if you ignore that. If she cannot say no (because of being drunk or otherwise incapacitated) then it is rape. I am sick and tired of seeing women whose lives have been ruined by men who think that they had some right to sex when they didn&#8217;t. This is a major issue, and to suggest women lack agency only perpetuates this.<br />
3) Emotions &#8211; This is implied more in the latter portion of the article. It should be made clear throughout that not only do not all women want all sexual acts, but not all women want or need extensive emotional attention during or after sex. Some do, but some don&#8217;t. To make it seem like all women do comes across as needy or weak, as if all women need a man to make them feel good about themselves. I am not saying that wanting attention after sex is weak or needy, but the suggestion that this is somehow an inherent quality of women is degrading. Conversely, not all men want to just sleep right after sex and require some emotional attention too. This is okay. Men are allowed to have just emotional needs just like women are allowed to have just physical needs.</p>
<p>Authors: I am trying to inform you of the amount of importance your words have on people. You are in a position of power, please do not abuse that right in ANY article because you do have the power to inform men and women of safe and healthy ways of seeing themselves and each other. Both men and women need to be presented as dynamic, 3D personalities with the capacity for more than just the stereotypical representation of gender roles. PLEASE TAKE THIS UNDER ADVISEMENT FROM A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN OBJECTIFIED AND SEEN OBJECTIFICATION TOO MUCH! IT IS SYMPTOMATIC OF OUR REPRESENTATION OF MEN AND WOMEN AND NEEDS TO CHANGE IF WE ARE TO EXPECT CONDITIONS FOR EITHER GENDER TO CHANGE.</p>

<p>Man 1: &#8220;When she starts to have an orgasm, for heaven’s sakes, don’t let go of that clit.&#8221;<br />
Man 2: sometimes they can&#8217;t take it at that point though, and push you away<br />
Man 1: Yeah, true<br />
Man 1: &#8220;This is too much, come and fuck me&#8221;<br />
Man 2: unlike blokes<br />
Man 1: &#8220;Is she going to eat it?&#8221;<br />
Man 2: she&#8217;s not gagging enough, the lazy bitch<br />
Man 1: more throat please<br />
Man 2: puke on it!<br />
Man 1: Now bring out the gimp!<br />
Man 2: wake up the gimp<br />
Man 1: &#8220;A man can get off and go to sleep in the same breath and feel no remorse, no sense of loss. But a woman by nature requires some sensitivity from her lover in those first few moments after sex.&#8221; &#8211; That&#8217;s the most annoying thing about it<br />
Man 1: She wants to cuddle, you want to wash your dick and smoke a cigarette, or have another glass of wine or something.<br />
Man 2: so true<br />
Man 2: everything but smoking and drinking is just fucking anoying at that point<br />
Man 2: you wanna hug? fuck off<br />
Man 1: where&#8217;s the lighter?<br />
Man 2: you wanna chat? fuck you!<br />
Man 1: check her pussy for a lighter &#8230;<br />
Man 2: sorry i&#8217;m busy keeping the smoke out my eyes whilst i&#8217;m washng my dick with both hands</p>

**But here is a handy tip if you have masterd these technics, you must tell the woman to completly relax and make any motion, no pleasure movement nothing only is she allowed to moan and breath nothing more. It will take a bit longer then normal but she will be climaxing for atleast 4min..**</p>
<p>P.S. This is only if you know what you are doing, orelse it will be a waste of time.</p>
<p>P.P.S. My appolygise for my crappish english, hope this works out for you. <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

Why do most people insist on faster and harder is better!?  I love eating pussy and after being trained thoroughly by the incredible women of Europe who are comfortable with who they are and have no problems giving directions.  90% of this is largely over complicated is all I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p>I agree with that all women are different.  60% of women never had an orgasm and only 10% physically can&#8217;t.  I believe its because both parties don&#8217;t understand simple mechanics.  Why make it more complicated than it should?</p>
<p>Two fingers in about 1 1/2 inches to 2 1/2 inches in &#8220;2 knuckle&#8221; rule, light pressure on the vaginal wall,  may want to slowly message may not even have to.  Lips around the clitoral hood tongue on the clitoris. WOW its like magic what a little pressure and slight movements of the tongue can do.  Natural body response will do 90% of the work&#8230;so you&#8217;re basically a prop so she can get herself off. </p>
<p>I take a lot of pride in my abilities to please because contrary to pornos&#8230;any idiot can get a guy off, it takes skill and finesse to please a woman.  I&#8217;ll give my technique an 80-85% effectiveness.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3536" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This article gives a lot of good tips.  As a woman who has had a few different partners, I know that not every man knows how to do it well.  Some are too rough or impatient so they can get to the final act. A few things to keep in mind:  1) A woman&#8217;s vagina is sensitive (if you&#8217;re too rough, she&#8217;s not going to like you going down on her at all and may want to avoid that part of sex).  2) Always, always keep communication open.  Hopefully you have a good relationship in which talking about sex is normal and not uncomfortable.  Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask what she likes before or during sex.  Not every woman is going to be comfortable enough to admit things during sex because they don&#8217;t want to disappoint their partner, but a woman who trusts a man will usually let him know if something is wrong during sex (when it feels uncomfortable or painful).  Do try to get a sense of what she likes before you even try anything though.  Like one commenter said, if they don&#8217;t want you around their ass, so to speak, they will let you know.  3) I agree with the writer of the article on one big thing.  Body cues or body language will tell you a lot.  Women communicate in different ways and if you&#8217;re doing something right, you&#8217;ll be able to tell by her breathing, her moans and if her hips are moving.  If you&#8217;ve accidentally done something wrong, she may shift uncomfortably, try to move away or make a sound of pain or displeasure.  Pay attention to this and do not continue until you figure out what happened, and if she wants you to continue.  The vagina and clit are very sensitive, and as a man, you may not be aware of how strong you are during sex.  This can sometimes translate into being rougher than you intended.  Just pay attention to her bodily cues.  </p>
<p>I also agree with another commenter about how respect is a HUGE deal.  It really is.  If you don&#8217;t respect a woman, how can you possibly please her?  And if you don&#8217;t want to please her, why are you bothering with sex?  Sex goes two ways; it is mutual.  If you take care of your partner, she will take care of you.  Always.  A woman who is pleased with her man sexually will be more willing to be adventurous in bed.  She will be affectionate and want to return the favor.  I am not one for casual sex; I never have been, but it&#8217;s not a bad idea to try to get to know someone a little before jumping into bed with them.  If you don&#8217;t like their personality, why are you with them?  Okay, I&#8217;ll get off of my soapbox, but I still agree that respecting a woman and her body is one of the key elements to pleasing her.</p>
<p>As for a woman&#8217;s &#8220;taste&#8221;, I think most women care about hygiene and will take care of themselves.  However, if you&#8217;re turned off by her smell or flavor, something is wrong.  You are clearly not attracted to this person as much as you thought.  If you were attracted to her, you would see her vagina as something magical.  Not to use anything extra personal, but my fiance loves mine.  He claims I am sweet there, unlike anything he&#8217;s had before, that I taste better than other girls he has had.  Diversely, I love being with him and I am more attracted to him than anyone I&#8217;ve ever been with.  He is so great at worshipping my body, my &#8220;pussy&#8221; included.  This makes me more willing to explore him and give him pleasure orally, something I was never really into before him.  So, you see.  Mutual respect, paying attention to your partner&#8217;s body, as well as their likes and dislikes with regards to sex, will go a long way.</p>

quite welcomed, but keep that mouth and fingers away from her pussy.</p>

she is 37, was 36 when we met. O took the time to listen to her, to I paid attention to her body movements when I was licking the Beave. (that is our Nick name for it) but It only took me one night to accomplish what no one else had ever done. I am not saying I am all that or even trying to brag. My point is if women would tell a man what she likes what feels good and what really does it for her. It would make it so much easier for men to accomplish the Big O for our woman. I love the taste of pussy, I especially like the gooey Orgasms. I love it when my girl comes home from work and before she takes a shower, I love to lick her pussy. It does not bother me that it is dirty because it is not. It is her, her scent is what I love. Not that of the soap she uses or feminine wash. I don&#8217;t know if I am crazy or just real. But I will stick my tongue in her ass in a second. And like it. I am not well endowed so I have to be good at something else. And when it comes to licking pussy. I am as good as I can be. If I can just give one piece of advice to men. Listen to her, pay attention to her movement when you are downstairs. You&#8217;ll know what she likes by the way she moves and when you figure it out. She is all yours. Just don&#8217;t take advantage of her. Be good to your girl, treat her with respect, dignity, like she is your everything. Because if you open the door you need to walk in and close it behind you. Don&#8217;t open her up and just to get a piece of ass and then dump her<br />
be up front if that is what you want. There is no shame in a one night stand, casual sex. Be honest with her from the beginning.<br />
SEMPER- GUMBY<br />
Yes I am a Marine and adjusted our motto to fit me. Always flexible.<br />
enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>Secondly, had I not known a rare few men who eat punani properly, the sheer amount of dudes who do it really lousy, whilst looking like they&#8217;re forcing themselves, is more than enough to Pavlov a woman into hating that crap.</p>
<p>Also, of course patriarchal society at large informs us regularly our nethers are disgusting in their natural state, smelly, foul etc, porn tells us we need to be hairless, labialess, colorless, so that def affects us subconsciously</p>

It felt so bloody amazing. It made me realise that I just had a bad case of men who were terrible at it beforehand.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3572" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I do not let many men go down on me, simply because many men are AWFUL at it. There is nothing worse than sitting there while somebody fumbles around your pussy, just doing what they&#8217;ve seen in pornos and expecting it to work. As the article says, it is a very very sensitive area that needs to be treated gently. And its also about variety! The same thing that gets you aroused in the first place will not get you off in the end. I have had many men just sit there and lap at my clit like a dog drinking water from a dish. And when it doesn&#8217;t work, they think doing it faster will make it any better. NO. Thats like me sitting there and just poking the tip of your dick over and over with my tongue. Its boring for both of us, and nobody gets off.<br />
It is discouraging for a woman, and there are SO many men who are terrible at it, that often times it is easier to say no than to subject ourselves to this torture over and over. I used to hate being eaten out as well. I was self conscious about my appearance and my smell as well. Worried about the sounds and the faces I made.. It wasn&#8217;t until I met my latest partner that I learned to finally relax and enjoy it. Now, he is great at it. But in the beginning, he was almost TOO good at it. He had a tendency to over-stimulate me. He would go to town on my overly-sensitive clit and make me shake and shudder right off the bed, clawing at the bed to get away from him. He had been with a lot of women in the past who overused vibrators and were not very sensitive, thus they liked his aggressive approach to oral sex. But I required a gentler touch. At least in the beginning. After a slow start, his skills always allowed him to get me off properly in the end. But it was good communication on both parts that allowed me to finally enjoy recieving oral sex as much as I enjoyed giving it!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3432" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>#1: Tell her anything, but get her to trust you enough to let you down between her legs.<br />
Okay, some woman are shy about their bodies and compliments are nice, but instead of buttering (I like coconut) them up with compliments and “tell her anythings”…  how about a conversation about it?  If a guy really likes going there he should say, “I really like this, want this and every thing<br />
associated with it.”  I think for most women it is less about body issues and more about bodily issues.  Make her feel comfortable in her body, not<br />
her beauty.<br />
#2 Some are tucked inside like a little girls cunnie.<br />
Yes, they are all different, unique and as beautiful as the women they belong to, but I like pita with hummus, not philes.<br />
#3 Women are a good deal more verbal than men.<br />
Sometimes just shut the fuck up and get to work.<br />
# 5,6 &amp; 7 Generalizations.<br />
Enough said.<br />
#8 Everything you do with a woman you’re about to eat must be done gently.<br />
Says who?  There is a time and place for everything.  Gentle (rhymes with genital) doesn’t always equal kind, just as rough doesn’t always equate violence.<br />
# 9 &amp; 10 Formulaic<br />
#11 The two finger rule?<br />
What the fuck?  Just like all the rest of the body parts available, there is not a one size fits all statute.  Fuck the two finger rule.<br />
#12 Symptoms?<br />
Signs… directives… nonverbal communications…  But symptoms? We are talking about the manifestation of a women’s sexuality not Ebola.  Wtf?<br />
#13 Don’t let go of her clit when she starts to orgasm.<br />
a.  Sometimes do let go of her clit, especially if a woman is multi-orgasmic and capable of more<br />
than just a clitoral orgasm.  Depending on what debauchery has been going on in a fuck session, this area might be over<br />
stimulated and tender.<br />
b.  If your fingers are inside move them gently?  Or not.  Juice that shit.<br />
c.  The women who wrote this are more vanilla than my beloved grandma’s secret recipe white cake.<br />
#14 Why the fuck did they skip over this?<br />
Seriously, this topic needs more talking about than any of the aforementioned and they just glossed the fuck over it.  All there talk of gentle this and that.  Gentle, rough, stimulated from the outside or in, or not at all.  These are things to be worked out between partners, but shouldn’t be ignored.<br />
#15 Let me just pass the fuck out.<br />
I am tired.  Shut up and give me space.  Not all women need to be coddled and not all men can get off and just off and go to sleep.  Jesus tits.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3423" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I definitely agree with the early points. Not the talking to it bit, but the bit about making sure she is comfortable with you being down there. I can&#8217;t stress how important it is to go with her comfort level, then continuously check-in with how she&#8217;s feeling by reading her body language with different things you&#8217;re doing. Don&#8217;t ask verbally. If you have to, pause and look at her with tenderness as if to ask permission. Asking isn&#8217;t sexy. If you&#8217;re in tune, you shouldn&#8217;t need to. So many women have suffered assholes that don&#8217;t savour the vagina like all women deserve. A few other commenters have already made the point that all woman are different. Not just in the physical structure, smell, taste, the sensitivity of their vee, but also in how much of their body they like to be involved in the stimulating. What I mean is some women get off with just clit stimulation, others need a finger for help and a hand running up their body. I personally have found better success with only one finger curled upwards into the rough ceiling of the vaginal canal (about 1-2 inches in) slowly making a &#8220;beckoning&#8221;  type of movement while paying oral attention to her clit. You can end up pushing quite hard and quickly on the roof of the vagina as she gets closer to orgasm, but start slow. Also, while doing this, I use my other hand spread wide on her pelvis (up towards her belly button) to help pull her clit hood up. With skinnier girls you can go under her leg and around to the belly, but with broader girls you may have to come from around the top depending on how long your arms are. I find the more you can involve the rest of her body (i.e, her legs pressing against your head, and the surface area you can carress and put under tension on her pelvis), the more she will thrust her whole body into the experience.</p>

Women using men for sex isn&#8217;t exactly a problem that men stereotypically face. Not that it doesn&#8217;t happen, just that (and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going out on a limb here) men do it more. All women deserve to be appreciated by their lover and have attention payed to them, as do all men. </p>
<p>Assuming that I meant guys are dicks if they don&#8217;t eat pussy is a bit of an oversimplification. </p>

I&#8217;ve met plenty of chicks that say they don&#8217;t like head, then sing a whole different tune after I&#8217;m finished with them. Btw, no girl anywhere really WANTS a fist up her ass, there are just some who don&#8217;t mind trying it to make you happy.</p>

<p>2. The fist was&#8230;.brace yourself&#8230; JUST AN EXAMPLE! MY POINT was that she needs to TELL him what she wants and not expect him to red her mind, and that goes both ways.. Many women don&#8217;t like head because they feel uncomfortable, not because guys suck at it and that you somehow are the only guy in the world who can please a woman (dumb-ass)..</p>
<p>Bottom line. If people talk about it. There wouldn&#8217;t be any problems.</p>

If it is not for you, then that&#8217;s you and I will respect that.  You come out and insult me, you apparently missed where it says on the top of this board that this is for &#8220;Grown-ass People!&#8221;  I do not consider myself emasculated or anything, just the fact that I am willing to do anything to please my wife in bed!  Someone who thinks like you is one of the reasons the divorce rate is so high.  I guess you are someone who uses women as objects of your satisfaction, could care less for satisfying your woman as long as you get off and jump from one woman to another?  Either that or you just have fun insulting people trying to have a serious discussion on here because i saw other comments of yours on here and all you seem to do is put other people down because you do not know how to truly satisfy a woman!   I do not know why I bother responding, because someone like you will never get it!</p>

The first step should only be done if you&#8217;re in a relationship otherwise you&#8217;ll look like a sleazebag but if you don&#8217;t care go ahead since it&#8217;ll relax her and get her ready. It is basic but you have to do it way before the sexual encounter because if she&#8217;s shy about her body, and you didn&#8217;t work her up psychologically way in advance, you&#8217;ll both have a terrible time. Especially if she hasn&#8217;t been exposed to such an expert level of pussy eating since probably other men rarely go down on her. Good guide though! Great tips for both loving boyfriends and newcomer playahs!</p>

Before we got together I loved to eat pussy anyways.  The first time we had sex it was amazing&#8230;we have a chemistry that is more intense than anything I have ever experienced.  The first time I took her pussy in my mouth and started giving her head it was like no other pussy I have ever tasted.  Unfortunately she is incarsarated at this time.  I have stood faithful to her this whole time. I feel sometimes that I&#8217;m simply strung out on her pussy. The phsycial attraction between us is amazing when we first got together she was very self contious about her appearance the way she looked. It took me a little while but we got past all of that and now if we are making love or fucking whatever the case maybe it is just simply undescribable.  We love each other very much and through letters or phone calls we express just how much we can&#8217;t wait to get into each others arms again.</p>

I rely a lot in my life on my tastebuds. I&#8217;ve adapted to a fair number ov cuisines from other countries and really enjoy the combinations ov tastes that most people would reject, such as haggis or curry. What I wanna know is: what taste(s) should be prepared for when eating my girl out? That has always been the one thing that has prevented me from trying oral with women since that&#8217;s the general vicinity in which urine comes from. Will pleasing her in this manner also turn me away from doing this again?</p>

I have found that the common ingredient is a savory salt. In all honesty, diet affects the taste the most. Coffee and cigarettes in high doses (more than a pot of coffee, a pack a day) turns me right off, but a woman with a healthy diet can be anywhere on the spectrum between magical butterscotch and divine citrus, always with a strong salty taste. You will not be disappointed, you will never taste urine, I promise. Once your partner becomes wet, it flushes all the flavour to the opening.  Arouse her, and you will smell the perfect perfume of sex.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3275" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>All of this above is ok, but it&#8217;s the product of three women, which, granted, is better than guys wondering among themselves. But my experience is this: Any guy who says he&#8217;s an expert at eating pussy is usually full of bullshit. There is no one way and there is no foolproof way. If a guy is really any good at this, what he&#8217;s good at is listening, observing and paying very close attention to every sigh and moan she lets out. Because, in my experience, every woman is different and every woman likes to get to an orgasm by her own route, a path that she alone prefers. I found #3 above, for example, just plain not true. For every woman who loves to hear you talk sexy when you go down on her, I have been with just as many who after a moment or two of sexy words grab my hair or ears and shove my face down on her as if to say, &#8220;Please, don&#8217;t talk. Just fuckin&#8217; shut up and eat me.&#8221; And finally, there are women who are just not into receiving oral. They&#8217;d rather give. They get more turned on by going down on a guy and somehow can&#8217;t let go and be the center of attention themselves. If I can find a way to get it out there early, before we become intimate, i let the woman know that i hope she can enjoy oral sex, not just a moment or two of somebody&#8217;s idea of required foreplay but some genuine extended oral attention. i tell a woman that i prefer to go down on a woman who either takes a long time to come or a woman who can come more than two or three times. i tell her that, for me, this is the most intimate kind of kiss a man can give a woman, so i dont like to rush it and I hope we can find a way for her to enjoy the way i kiss.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3283" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Firstly, please don&#8217;t reduce your marriage and relationship to the comparisons of sex between him and an ex-lover/ex-luster. I&#8217;m sure, for you to marry him seven years ago, he has many redeeming qualities that make him a good husband.</p>
<p>Secondly, most men will always ask for blow jobs, it&#8217;s just what they do. Men are more verbal about their sexual wants, and have no guilt or shame in asking for them. Sometimes to a fault, but most times they&#8217;re just asking for what they want.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I think you and your husband may need to spend more time learning how to have sex in a way that belongs purely to you and not to anyone outside your relationship. By this I mean that, from your comment, it comes across that you&#8217;re constantly comparing your current love life to a previous one with an ex, and this is extremely damaging to a sexual relationship. Imagine if he told you you&#8217;re not as good a lover or even as good at giving head as his previous girlfriend. What would that do to your sense of security? With some more honest communication I&#8217;m sure the two of you can find a way to make love to each other that&#8217;s unique to you. Something you can&#8217;t possibly find boring because it&#8217;s filled with passion and love. And if it&#8217;s not filled with either of those two, then your marriage needs some work.</p>
<p>But please, go back to number one. Marriage isn&#8217;t only about sex. It may be a large factor, but it cannot be the only pivotal aspect of a marriage. It simply cannot be, because a deep, soulful, meaningful, and loving relationship with another human being is more than just sexual favours, endorphin highs, and the idea of the &#8220;best sex&#8221; ever.</p>

If you&#8217;ve been with her for a while it might be easier, but probably not. There might be a medical reason she&#8217;s not smelling right. She could&#8217;ve been on a course of antibiotics that have caused a yeast infection or she could have an STD. She might be over cleaning herself, ie douching (which is not good for our vaginas at all). Question all of that and maybe ask if she&#8217;s been in for a physical lately. Pap smears are the easiest way to detect something wrong downstairs. In the end, you&#8217;ll likely just have to say something and hope she doesn&#8217;t get pissed or hurt. But if she can&#8217;t have an honest conversation about any of this without getting upset, she likely isn&#8217;t mature enough to have sex, just my opinion.</p>

What happened to spontaneity??!!&#8221; To which I said that I love eating pussy and I do not eat pussy if it ain&#8217;t clean. So maybe that&#8217;s something you should start doing. Making sure you both take a shower always before sex and she knows all will be bacteria and smell free so she can relax. She may be worried about you smelling something. </p>

The reason why I am able to float as long as I want in her gravity is because she trust me with her body. Communication is key for building trust with your partner. This allows your partner to reach new heights in her orgasms which eventually tighten your bond in a deeper levels. </p>
<p>I say to the opposite sex that one must enjoy oral sex so much that he or she can achieve orgasm without penetration of the penis inside of a vagina or vice versa. If you are able to do just that oral sex will be view differently from your partner. </p>
<p>What I enjoyed most about oral sex is how a skillful tongue can drive your partner to total madness if you study your partner correctly. Do not just lick her pussy without knowing her terrain, this will cause you to be lost and show a sign of being inpatient and selfish. Something a women would dislike very much. Another tip fellas, while performing oral sex make eye contact with her and tell her how much you enjoy the sounds of her  juices against your tongue. The softness of her ass, the scent of her connection toward you, and how delightful it will be for you to climax inside of my mouth.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3165" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Men&#8230; Please. The clit is like a tiny penis. I can not stress how many men think that women get their feeling from them being inside of her. You&#8217;re in the hole, not touching her clit AT ALL. You know nothing about the female body, yet I had a guy complain about why I want him to focus on my clit. He said &#8220;You and this clit&#8221; like &#8220;why are you so fixated on your clit being touched&#8221;. That&#8217;s like me only licking a guy&#8217;s balls then when he saying &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you touch my dick&#8221; I ask why he wants me to touch his dick, like a retard who doesn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s where he gets all his pleasure from. The CLI T is the focal point of her pleasure. You need to lick it, and suck it, and play with it. It shocks me how many guys don&#8217;t know this. PS. teasing her makes her clit a little harder, you just cant go down there and start licking a soft clit, the same way a woman can&#8217;t just go down there and start licking a soft dick when the guy is far from being turned on. Doesn&#8217;t it feel better when she&#8217;s touching a hard cock? Isn&#8217;t your cock more sensitive when it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m virgin, so I enjoy oral a lot. It shocks me the amount of non virgin men who have more experience than me who are ignorant about a woman&#8217;s clit, and they completely ignore it.</p>

Naturally, a woman becomes more sensitive (in a good way) and aroused internally once she has come once. Often, dragging on foreplay can become tiresome &#8211; give her orgasms in different ways!</p>

If she&#8217;s got 3 kids and the pussy is just a large gaping hole, forget about it.<br />
Also important is hygiene.<br />
She might be hot, but if she&#8217;s not clean shaved, and smells like rotting fish, don&#8217;t tell me to go down on it.<br />
If you want your man to lick it, then shave it.<br />
All of it.<br />
Pubic hair is just gross.<br />
All that urine, sweat, salt, oil and blood isn&#8217;t very conducive to a good pussy licking.<br />
Be clean and get your pussy licked all the time.<br />
A lot of gross women don&#8217;t get it and they&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Why nobody wants to lick me&#8221;?</p>

<p>mrXander your comment made me laugh.  I think its just a different mindset.  Some guys have standards for what they like and some guys like absolutely anything they can get, from a 10 to a 1.  Nothing wrong with either perception, but I do know a few guys who bragged to me about how many women they scored with and yet none of them would even have gotten a second look from me.  If you don&#8217;t really want to screw her, it&#8217;s boring.  Totally agree on the pubic hair too, nothing pleasant, manicured of bare please.</p>

I remember reading it on a green screen VAX terminal in the computer lab during my freshman year of college back in 1995. I&#8217;m certain it is the same article because some of the phrasing is unforgettably silly.</p>
<p>Not saying that being old necessarily invalidates any of this&#8230; it&#8217;s just amazing to me how this article is  still circulating after almost two decades (basically EONS in &#8220;internet time&#8221;)</p>

What a stupid thing to say. If you aren&#8217;t going to be happy being with someone for that reason then you are shallow as hell. I mean, if that&#8217;s a make or break thing for you, whatever. Your priorities are probably not where they need to be for you to experience a successful marriage. You should at least have the self awareness and understanding about your partner to know if you should marry them based on whether or not this physical need will be satisfied by them before you say your vows. That&#8217;s such an immature, threatening way to act. &#8220;You better suck and fuck me right or I&#8217;m going to betray you&#8221;. Such a cuntish slut approach to life. Having the right sexual chemistry with your partner is extremely important, so make sure you&#8217;re with someone you have chemistry with. Don&#8217;t try to hold someone emotionally hostage. If that&#8217;s the attitude you have about marriage then you shouldn&#8217;t be deciding to marry anyone anytime soon. You shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to make decisions about a lot of things actually.</p>

A man that likes to eat pussy is because he&#8217;s naturally predisposed, then he does the job great!<br />
A man that doesn&#8217;t like it could read 100 times the above article and still be lost in action&#8230;.and make it wrong!<br />
There are two categories of men: ones that know how to give pleasure, and ones that will never understand how.<br />
Both categories don&#8217;t need to study books or get tought, they have or not that GIFT to feel and like women!<br />
Experiences can help and improve the individual skillness, but they can never transform a denied man into a natural gifted one.<br />
Of course the man that likes to eat pussy is the best lover on earth because he knows well all the rest who comes before, besides and after&#8230;<br />
Sorry for my bad English, I&#8217;m a foreigner.</p>

Some prefer being on the backs, others enjoy riding your mouth, there&#8217;s also 69 which would require different techniques for enjoying the experience more. Let&#8217;s not forget from the back as the picture kindly gestures, but mostly from the doggy-style standpoint. One must be gentle that&#8217;s certain but some women will grab your head and pull you in to make it rougher. There are so many aspects to go by but some of the information is correct. Then again we all have our own preferences so the information will most likely be inadequate for some, all the while working charmingly for others. I would suggest that you study your partner, pay close attention to what she likes, or even talk to her before getting to that point.</p>

It makes me feel sorry for the author that she hasn&#8217;t experienced g-spot finger fucking. Wow. So sad!! I had one other friend (an old roommate) who didn&#8217;t know anything about it, and she also had issues achieving orgasms, so she let me do it to her!! Haha. #NoHomo but it was fun and cool to get to be the reason she achieved her biggest orgasm ever! <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> The in and out movement is nothing compared to pushing repeatedly on the inner g-spot. </p>
<p>So, if the girl is on her back, belly facing up, and the guy&#8217;s two fingers are all the way inside (palm facing up), he would make the &#8220;come here&#8221; motion with some force, while eating her out. It&#8217;s difficult to explain in writing, and it&#8217;s kinda awkward explaining in general, but the woman who wrote that article is missing out, BIG TIME.</p>

<p>Next time how about &#8220;when you feel her move and respond to your tongue, flick your tongue lightly against her clit, then slide your tongue down the lips of her pussy and gently glide it between them&#8221;  and not try to use descriptions that make me think the next words out of your mouth are going to be cock meat, stank taint or cunt hole.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2701" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As to #13 that is not always true. I&#8217;ve had women who get too sensitive during and after orgasm so touching the clit even the slightest is painful. For these women skipping straight to 15 during is pretty much okay and can still cause multiple orgasm. Which by the way isn&#8217;t having more than one orgasm a night. It is having multiple peaks during the same orgasm. There is a difference.</p>
<p>Also I kinda think an article that says, &#8220;Here are the thing to do for being good at this&#8221; but then also says in one of it&#8217;s steps &#8220;Everyone is different so try different stuff&#8221; could have all been condensed to that one step. Namely #12. I think that may be the best and only necessary advice, along with &#8220;ask your partner.&#8221; I guess some of these may work if you are clueless and your partner is uncommunicative, but it seems like that might be a recipe for disaster anyway. One not knowing what to do, and the other unwilling or unable to tell them. I guess I could say thank you, for if we ever meet I&#8217;m saved the &#8220;trouble?&#8221; of trying to find out what works on you, but to anyone else I&#8217;d say don&#8217;t take this as gospel. The absolute best thing to do is try to get your partner comfortable enough to show or tell you what works, or figure out how to tell when it works if they can&#8217;t tell you.</p>

A LOT of men don&#8217;t know what the hell they are doing when it comes to this no matter how much they think or say they do. Also most women fake it which I don&#8217;t believe in, why give them credit if they didn&#8217;t earn it, tell them what they are doing wrong so they learn don&#8217;t just shut up and fake it&#8230;poor guy lol. This article is on point, guys please try all of this..maybe not the anal unless she asks, some girls will freak or it will turn them off but I guarantee if you do everything else even if she says she doesn&#8217;t like it shes full of shit and not giving it a chance, there&#8217;s no way a woman wouldn&#8217;t enjoy all of this and if she claims this then she&#8217;s a prude and not worth your time, unless she has some underlying problem or issues down there then that&#8217;s another story and you can give her a break or be persistent about getting her off no matter what the issue is if she lets you lol. Women need to experience this and most never do which is sad because it&#8217;s the best feeling in the world and every women should get this feeling at least once in their life. A REALLY REALLY HIGH percentage of women never orgasm no matter what and it sucks but fortunately I&#8217;ve been blessed achieving this every time because he knows what he&#8217;s doing lol. LADIES&#8230;give this all a chance, if your not open minded and willing to try then your missing out on an amazing experience and screwing yourself over lol just go with it and try it, you need to be mentally in the right place and focus on it..relax and let go.MEN&#8230;Let the woman know this tip before you start, awkward or not, if you want to succeed and feel good about yourself after then communicate and make her feel confident. </p>

I don&#8217;t believe this is the case. Maybe they haven&#8217;t, but it is possible. All women have the same parts. Sure they may look different but basically they are they same. Just like you mentioned in the end, most of it has to do with comfort, along with trust, confidence and experience. So much goes on in the mind of a woman, and at the same time as well. The man has to learn the skills, be patient, practice and never give up. I dated a lady for a year and a half before we achieved her very first orgasm, at age 42. Now that she has had them, they come more often and with more intensity too. It can be done.</p>

Either your going to write the article more raunchy or more conservitive just my opionion. While their is some obvious key points here like make your girl feel comfortable and that shes is wet there are a few things I am like oh hell no =)) that will creep me out. Do not talk to her vagina &amp; do not talk about her vagina while your down there. Shut up and lick that pussy all over in out you name it. Only thing you should be saying to her about her pussy is your delcious and its tight if it is true that is. If you start having a convo about my pussy yah you will probably not get another try. Also just staring at it and looking at how beautiful it is that is wierd as fuck. That is a good way to make any women creeped out if a man is just staring at your vagina. Look admire quickly enjoy the view and get to licking and sucking on it. Your girl knows what she likes and the first key is getting her comfortable with it and to a point where she feels like she can tell you what she likes either by voicing it or grabbing your head and moving it where she wants.</p>

After she orgasms the first time (IF she orgasms a first time), I leave my &#8220;hot mouth&#8221; on it in an &#8220;O&#8221; shape I guess? And my tongue does what?<br />
It goes in and out of which part? The part where the pneu goes into?<br />
And I wanted to ask something else: mine is pretty close to my mouth so should I use it AND the tongue at the same time if I can?<br />
I mean should I use it instead of my fingers since it&#8217;s so close to my mouth? </p>

Some dirty talk is ok, but this article is telling him to keep going on and on about how beautiful shit is? No. Say something sexy and move on. I don&#8217;t wanna hear poems and declarations of beauty, and your mouth should now too busy for speeches anyway. </p>
<p>Also, (and numerous of my girlfriends agree) two fingers sucks! One feels WAY better and teases more. With two you can feel knuckles and shit, and it&#8217;s just not as good. </p>
<p>Thirdly, as many other ladies have commented, constant direct stimulation to the clit can be too much. If i had someone sucking on it and holding on and going harder as i tried to move away I would probably yell at them. It&#8217;s not a dick and you certainly can not suck it for more than a few seconds at a time. </p>
<p>And lastly, tongue fucking is ridiculous. It&#8217;s too short to do anything good, and it basically just feels like a dying fish flopping around. Stahhp, go back to licking kissing and sucking and use your finger for the fucking thanks.</p>
<p>If someone followed this article to the letter I would brand him sucky at giving head, and talk shit to my gfs.</p>

Ladies- if you have a guy doing this for you and he&#8217;s got a similar attitude as me, please do ride the power thrill (if you&#8217;re feeling it) and use your hand to press him in and manipulate his head.

<p>It is not technically a beautiful little flower. It are more akin to the kangaroo&#8217;s pouch, or if you are interesting enough, more like a Sarlacc.</p>
<p>Try to remove yourselves from the chains of our sex drives for a brief second, and look at them with an unbiased look. They are occasionally moist, hairy holes on the surface of the body, that leak various fluids, and get funky if unattended. </p>
<p>Now compare them to the penis, frequently vilified in the popular culture as disgusting. Not a hole, sizeable proportion not covered by hair, standalone, transformable appendage, much less likely to leak random stuff, easier to clean, less likely to get funky if unattended. Kind of similar to an elephant&#8217;s trunk.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, do you consider an elephants trunk disgusting? What if an elephant had a gaping, leaking, hairy hole on its side? How would you feel about that?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I throughly love eating pussy, hair or not, period or not, all shapes and sizes. But that does not change the fact that pussy is disgusting.</p>

Yes, there&#8217;s fluid down there, but it&#8217;s completely benign, like spit. Going down on a woman is good if you and your partner enjoy it and not good if you don&#8217;t. If you personally think cunnilingus is nasty, don&#8217;t just do it while holding your nose, so to speak. She&#8217;s sure to feel your disgust, and any sex that doesn&#8217;t please both/all participants isn&#8217;t going to be all that great.</p>

But I have a little issue with some of the specific stimulation instructions. Not all women want or can handle direct stimulation of their clitoris, even when excited. I used to think it was just me, but have now slept with enough women to know I&#8217;m not entirely unique. And unfortunately a lot of people are led to believe that the clit is the go-to spot for every girl, and getting that assumption out of their head when it&#8217;s between your legs can be a little tricky. <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  I guess my point is, every woman is DIFFERENT and to be an exceptional lover you simply need to pay attention to what the woman you are WITH is telling/showing you. Trust me, she wants you to do it the way SHE likes it.  <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

If you love someone or care about them then you want them to enjoy things as much as you do..I stunningly large amount of women don&#8217;t get off by vaginal stimulation so it should be important to the partner to help the woman reach the same level of enjoyment. Men&#8211; if you didnt like it at first then try try again and maybe u just havent met the right person to show this level of intimacy to, or maybe your just a selfish lover..thats between ur girl and her girl friends <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> and the amount of detail is necessary when u basically write a how-to guide and if someone&#8217;s alone reading it and still feels shame, then perhaps they aren&#8217;t as confident as they think. <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> and one more thing&#8230;just because a person writes about something and posts it on the internet, does not necessarily mean they are looking for validation&#8230;they&#8217;re sharing knowledge which is fine <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

I&#8217;m glad to see it again as I wanted to have a copy for myself. Shame the original author was never credited. </p>
<p>Also to the to the other posters: this was written in a different time.There weren&#8217;t ads celebrating women&#8217;s bodies of different shapes and sizes like there are today. There also wasn&#8217;t a massive choice of oral sex how to&#8217;s on the web &#8211; like the one&#8217;s I see linked just above this article. Take from it what you will. </p>
<p>PS. Jansen &#8211; A vagina doesn&#8217;t naturally smell foul, let&#8217;s get that out of the way right now. If it smells foul, there&#8217;s an issue and she needs to see her gyn.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2659" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>most of this is true.<br />
however. most men will say they know how to please a woman. just as many women know how to give oral sex to their partner every man is different and prefer things differently rather its a swirling motion with the tongue arnd the head as she caresses the sack and strokes. or just a good ole deep throat fast motion.<br />
but back to the main point here. THE WOMANS &#8216;O&#8217;<br />
EVERY woman is different some are more sensitive than others. and there are some women who have a hard time to climax from clitoral stimulation. this is a fine caress that gets vigorously rough during or vice versa it may be a feather light touch the whole time.<br />
*NO.1 be sure your hands are NOT tough. no rough skin. TRIMMED NAILS&#8230; and obviously CLEAN HANDS&#8230;. the vagina is a vessel that is very acceptable to bacteria no matter how clean she is. its not like a guy that can wash his junk off from the sink dry it and go on. a womans vagina on average is 6&#8221; deep until aroused. hence on why she can take a average 5-6&#8221; cock vs the well endowed 8-12&#8221; cocks. JUST BE SURE YOUR CLEAN. <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
*NO2 be sure she is WET b4 you touch her with hands&#8230;rather its a lube saliva whatever. WE DO NOT LIKE SANDPAPER. it hurts.<br />
**NO3 dont get discouraged if she isnt moaning.<br />
some women do not moan. they arent vocal like some of the screamers you see on you.porn etc. &#8211;same as squirters. there are many NON-squirters vs. the spuirters&#8230; play your cards right and she just might become one. when she starts to climax as long as shes not fighting you to get off your hurting her. keep on her&#8230; steady fast whatever. dont let go of that ride.<br />
**NO4. smells. a womans vagina typically does not have a odor.<br />
is she does. shes A. either not clean&#8230; or B. there is some kind of issue with her FLORA aka. her PHbalance. sometimes a mans sperm can cause a womans flora to go off track. she may have a uri, vaganitist, bacterial vagnosis there are many issues that can be off with a womans body.but IF SHE DOES. dont be rude. many women are very self conscious about oral sex anyways bc of the way we as humans are and treat one another. no matter how they appear. unless shes 100% secure about her body she may still fell not all that fresh.. if that is the case. get all sexy and run the bath or shower. freshen up together. FELLAS&#8230; sometimes your junk stinks also. then you cram our heads on your funk. not cool&#8230;.<br />
same thing about hair&#8230;&#8230; this is a whole other story if you like it trimmed and shes bushy get sexy and shave her&#8230; just be careful&#8230;<br />
**NO5. be in tuned with her . dont make her undress herself unless she is while you are.<br />
be sensual. and yes fellas you all can do this its not hard. be sexy tell her how much you enjoy her body..doesnt matter if shes a gf wife fling bootycall 1ns etc. women like to hear you enjoy them that they are not just a sex toy for you.<br />
tell her what you want to do to her. talk to her tell her you want to be submissive and let her take control telling you what to do.<br />
there is nothing hotter than telling a man to get between your legs start at the bottom ridge and glide upwards wink wink&#8230; you get the hint.</p>
<p>fellas this is a topic this is wayyyyy beyond what is listed in the original post.<br />
altho it is good information.<br />
but communication is key when it comes to sex. its not get hard. stick your finger in a few times have sex roll over go to sleep or get dressed. times have changed. this is not taboo anymore. and your never too old to learn new tricks.<br />
just keep in mind EVERY WOMAN IS DIFFERENT. what may work on a ex. might not work on the new girl. and REMEMBER TO NEVER. compare women. or do the same routine switch it up get wet and have fun.<br />
thanks for reading. hope this helps</p>

<p>2. The author writes that all girls will care about what their partner thinks of their bodies&#8230; Why are we constantly telling women that they need to get this kind of bodily acceptance from an outside source?! It&#8217;s infuriating. Sure, its nice to hear how hot your partner thinks you are, but if you are 100% comfortable and into your bod, there is little doubt your partner will also be.</p>

It&#8217;s a devil keeping that poor &#8230;..um&#8230;feminine area up and completely healthy. It&#8217;s not as rare as you might think.  And it&#8217;s not always due to lack of cleanliness. Sometimes a woman&#8217;s body just likes to put her through hell just because it can. Whether it be due to pH balance/levels, her cycle, an illness, outside factors, etc. But frak yes. It&#8217;s awesome to see people willing to share info on things to try/add to your schedule to make things even more enjoyable for your partner. Now if only I could figure out how to enjoy the act more. Ah well&#8230;.add least there&#8217;s always good imported chocolate. That&#8217;s better than any sex.

I&#8217;ve always loved, and I initiate, cunnilingus. Of the 15 or so women I&#8217;ve been with (each multiple times) and enjoyed cunnilingus with during the past ten years, only one of those fifteen woman had what to me was an off-putting &#8220;flavor&#8221;, and even that wasn&#8217;t so off-putting that I couldn&#8217;t ignore it and continue for her sake and pleasure. </p>
<p>Soooo&#8230;it might be helpful to keep in mind that, 1) Although one guy might consider a taste and/or smell repulsive, since guys vary in their senses and sensitivities of taste/smell, another guy or many or even most other guys might be fine with that same taste/smell;<br />
             and that, 2) Even if a guy experiences one woman&#8217;s smell/taste being off-putting, he shouldn&#8217;t assume that he&#8217;ll experience the same with all nor even most other women.</p>
<p>But, if a guy truly is repulsed by cunnilingus, that is ultimately his prerogative, same as it&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s prerogative to dislike fellatio, anal penetration, or any other sexual option and variety (I even know of a few women who dislike receiving cunnilingus).<br />
After all, there&#8217;s no Cosmic Decree that everyone is obligated to like doing everything, is there?</p>
