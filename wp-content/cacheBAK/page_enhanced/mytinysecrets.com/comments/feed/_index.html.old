		<description><![CDATA[I got a little &quot;muffin top &#039;thing&quot; from having a baby. I weighed 121 pounds when I first got pregnant, and then gained 45 pounds, have lost 20 since. I didn&#039;t get the stretch marks or anything until after I had my baby. I never had a &quot;muffin top&quot; either, and I don&#039;t know if it will ever truly be gone because my skin is now stretched. Guess I&#039;m just considered ugly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I presume you have a body like a young Arnie and are dating a supermodel? Because if not, a little bit judgemental. I mean, your body must be absolutely perfect right to go around judging other peoples, especially women who have stretch marks from a little thing called pregnancy. My mum showed me the stretch marks she has from giving birth to me, it made me overwhelmingly happy that she went through that for me-just like it should make any man love a woman who does that to give birth to his child. Women are already bombarded with images of stick thin models who make women with lower confidence feel like shit without having to come onto articles like this one and see a man (who frankly, from your pic is nothing special) being judgemental. Get over yourself]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really love eating out my gf, she tastes amazing and looks amazing and that works much better for her than just sex. But recently she read somewhere that HSV-1 which is a cold sores most of us have can turn into genital herpes on her vagina if I give oral sex to her even if I don&#039;t have actual sores on my lips. And it can later affect pregnancy in a bad way. It sounds like nonsense as 65-90% of the world population have HSV-1 virus and lots of them lick their girls and I don&#039;t think it causes problems to anyone as soon as you don&#039;t do it when you have an actual sores outbreak on your lips. But she&#039;s determined about it and now I can&#039;t do nothing with her pussy and anal area too. That is so lame, I miss it so much. And simple sex doesn&#039;t get off neither her, nor me. :/]]></description>
