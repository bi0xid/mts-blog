<p>So according to the magazine Cosmopolitan this is the new plus-size model. Right. Yes. Of course, she is plus-size. So if she is plus-size what does normal size look like?</p>
<p>No wonders this society is screwed up if the media declares this as Plus-Size.</p>

<h2>This picture too became super viral on my Facebook Wall. For good reason.</h2>

<h4>How does this make you feel?</h4>
<p>Much love, Adina</p>
<p>P.s. Please share this with your friends. It is crucial that we help this society to create a healthy natural image of the female body. I am sure Cosmopolitan did not have any bad intentions, but we have to become more mindful about what we say and how we see women. I am no crazy feminist, but the female body and mind has been exposed to so much mind-manipulation that it is about time reinforce a healthy natural idea of a female&#8217;s body. No plastic surgery, no hardcore fancy diets. Just a healthy, mindful life.</p>

I&#8217;m guessing (because I&#8217;m tall too) that she can&#8217;t buy pants in most stores. The clothing for average size women would be too short on top, and the length of the pants would be too short&#8230;.so technically she&#8217;s plus sized. I think she looks amazing&#8230;..I also think we&#8217;re a little hypersensitive when it comes to categorizing people as skinny, plus size, large, fat, curvy, whatever. I don&#8217;t cry when people say I&#8217;m tall&#8230;.and I&#8217;m sure this goddess doesn&#8217;t give a damn about what people say about plus-sized fashion, she&#8217;s getting PAID.</p>

I know I&#8217;m plus size now, but when I was younger I was 140lbs and a size 12. There&#8217;s no fricken way I was plus size back then. I wasn&#8217;t even pudgy. My body wasn&#8217;t perfect, I could have lost a few pounds, but I was not fat or plus size.</p>

The average height of American women is 5&#8217;4 (64 inches). Taking into account that a standard deviation of height is approx. 3 inches (really, for women it is 2.8), then she is roughly 3.3-3.5 standard deviations outside the normal height range for women. She&#8217;s a real outlier in height, so that skews her weight/waist/other ratios immensely. Calling her plus-size is accurate in a sense, because she&#8217;s kinda Amazonian in stature. But plus-size in the nomenclature to reflect our idea of larger women who wear sizes 16-20-something? Yeah&#8230; not a real accurate reflection.</p>

Yes, she&#8217;s tall and built, but she would be about a size 10, maybe 12. A true plus size is size 16+. Here&#8217;s an example, I&#8217;m 5&#8217;6&#8243; at 145 I was a size 12, and quite frankly in the best shape of my life. Now I&#8217;m a size 16/18, barely a plus size, and I KNOW I&#8217;m fat. Other than our height, the model and myself are similarly built. I have wide shoulders, narrow arms, long torso, and a big chest. This is what I looked like when I was @ 145 and a size 12. Here&#8217;s a fact for you, the store that caters to plus sizes  (Lane Bryant) carries size 16 and up. In fact, the size 16 and 18 are actually hard to find, because it&#8217;s borderline plus size. So no, this beautiful, healthy, sexy woman is NOT a plus size.</p>

However, we all should know that size 8 is considered plus-sized in the modeling industry. The concern here is that we should all be striving to be as healthy as possible, while understanding that NOT ALL WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE A SIZE 2. Just like all men can&#8217;t have wash-board abs. Just like some men just don&#8217;t have the ability to build up muscle like the latest cookie cutter male model, not all women can rid themselves of the hips they were gifted with. We were all created to be different shapes and sizes, and as long as you are as healthy as you can be, your size shouldn&#8217;t matter, because honestly, everyone&#8217;s healthiest size is different. There is no one right or wrong size to be.</p>

With america&#8217;s obesity problem, people have skewed the idea of what being plus sized is. Most females that claim to be &#8220;curvy&#8221; are Morbidly obese. People simply have no idea what BMI (body mass index) is anymore, or for that matter have any clue what is or is not, overweight. yes, the picture/link you posted is plus sized.<br />
while this picture may not be the nicest of pictures, i&#8217;ve seen it on facebook and said to myself &#8220;at least someone out there has a clue&#8221;. <a href="http://funlolx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Girls-Who-Don%E2%80%99t-Accept-500x355.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://funlolx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Girls-Who-Don%E2%80%99t-Accept-500&#215;355.jpg</a> the curvy woman in the picture, based on her BMI, is in fact, plus sized also. These are not &#8220;medias ideas of being skinny&#8221; it&#8217;s science!<br />
As someone that isn&#8217;t even an author, i&#8217;ll back my facts up with proof, unlike this poor excuse for an online article.<br />
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html</a><br />
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html</a></p>
<p>these facts are based on the CDC (center for disease control), NOT the media!<br />
that being said, if you&#8217;re happy with your body, more power to you! But please, lets be honest, if you&#8217;re fat based on science, don&#8217;t go acting like a fool trying to get the rest of the world to change their stance on what overweight is just because you simply don&#8217;t want to be called &#8220;fat&#8221;. with my height and weight, i&#8217;m bordering on being obese, and guess what, i own up to it.</p>

If we use fat models we will only encourage more people to stay fat, and obesity costs taxpayers more per year than smoking. If women want to be fat, fine, but don&#8217;t shame the rest of us who choose to be healthy and have self control. This girl is plus sized because she is on the heavier end of healthy, if not overweight. Unfortunately we&#8217;ve become a society that decided the solution to the obesity epidemic was to raise the weight standard for BMI. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2644" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Are you serious nicole? how about instead of arguing whilst having no facts to back you up you do some damn research. the models name is literally right there! Not only is she 6&#8217;2 and 180 pounds she is a size 12 not a size 4! Not to mention this photo your saying she looks like a size 4 in was probably photo shopped to high heaven since it was for cosmo. While I would agree that BMI isnt a very good system because despite being and looking healthy i was always considered  underweight but in Americas vanity sized clothing (which *SURPISE* is a whole nother crock of bs) I can fit in anything between a 0 and a 3. Do you know why America uses vanity sizing? So girls dont feel bad about their weight and therefore are more likely to buy clothes. Its literally all a fucking sales ploy. No one said that she was unhealthy or fat. They called her a plus sized model and here thats anything over a size 8 and i dont know about you but at about 5ft and 90 pounds that girl would make a dwarf of me. But despite that she looks beautiful happy and PROUD to be a plus sized model. The real problem with america is that so many woman care more about what others think of them than being comfortable in their own skin like this lovely young model is.</p>

(I agree with most of what you say though). I think she looks beautiful the size that she is, although I have read articles stating that she wishes the modelling industry would just use models appropriate to the size of clothes/ relevance of the model to the brand etc. not labelling people as plus sized etc. By putting people into these groups it means that people who are the epitome of &#8216;ideal weight&#8217; as recommended by doctors/ BMI etc (obviously varies alot but usually around a UK size 10/ US 6-8) very seldom get used in the industry as they are not quite slim enough to be regular models while not quite plus sized. In fact a lot of models who have slightly wider bone structure etc find themselves in the position where they have to actively put weight on so they can model as plus sized (including this model). Not, in my opinion, the best message &#8211; but then the modelling industry has never really been about health and well being&#8230;</p>

I&#8217;m 17 and does the media have any idea of the issues they are causing girls today? I can name a girl in my class with an eating disorder or body image distortion for every toe and finger I have. plus some. They don&#8217;t realize how painful they are making it for girls to grow up now a days. It took me 17 years to realize I love the beach. I hated it because I thought when I was fat ever since I learned what fat was. It&#8217;s not fair that it is impossible to feel slightly secure in yourself even as a little girl anymore. Why do women have these expectations but men do not? Yes they have the pressure to be fit but not to be skinny. Can&#8217;t the media either back off or feature real women who have a shape. There is nothing wrong with being skinny as long as the media shows there is nothing wrong with being curvy either. This woman is gorgeous not just because she naturally is, but also because I can&#8217;t see her ribs, she&#8217;s tall, she has those little things of skin right were her arm meets her armpit, she doesn&#8217;t have abs, she has gorgeous thighs and&#8230; shall I continue? Why not lay off the skinny thing for a while, media? Before you kill off all you&#8217;re younger readers who are desperately trying to meet your outlandish expectations.</p>

We are cherished creatures that give life to this world and no matter what we look like, we are beautiful. People need to recognize that. Not the fact that our ass is huge or tiny or we have big boobs or flat, or even we have alot of curves. We are what make this world carry on and strive. If it werent for woman, this planet would die. This picture depicts a beautiful model that is healthy and has curves. She is beautiful, but so is all the other woman in this world. No matter race, colour of hair, eyes, big small, boobs, no boobs&#8230;. we are woman. Beautiful ! Men should Respect that. Listen to your mother!</p>

<p>The term &#8220;plus-size&#8221; has NOTHING to do with the model being fat, ugly, unattractive, useless, repulsive or whatever other crap I have seen being spewed all over the internet when non-industry people gets all huffed up and tries to link the term to a ton of nonsense.</p>
<p>Kate Upton is considered a plus-size model, for crying out loud! I personally don&#8217;t think you will find a more sexy, attractive woman on the planet right now, so stop taking a technical term, quickly defining a model as unable to fit the usual size 6 that you will find on a fashion photo shoot, as something that describes a lot of subjective details about her as a woman. It&#8217;s not. It just lets the art director, designer or photographer know, that if they want to use this model, they will need to make sure that they have the clothes that fit, and can&#8217;t expect her to slip into the standard size 6 used by models that are not plus-size.</p>
<p>That Cosmo uses a technical term in an article without explaining it is their mistake, but technically they are definitely correct &#8211; she is a plus-size model, and a gorgeous one at that.</p>

I cannot stand seeing a woman&#8217;s ribs in a swimsuit or any skimpy clothing. I also do not want to see a six pack, it makes the women look ugly, yuck! Nothing sexy about either of these things. I personally believe that most men like and prefer a woman to look like this model. The problem is they&#8217;re afraid to admit it in public because of peer pressure. Women who too skinny are paraded and touted as beautiful and that simply needs to stop. As I say to my wife when I see the ribs on those girls, &#8220;somebody needs to feed them a cow to put some meat on those bones.&#8221; And another thing, I&#8217;ve read that two-thirds of Americans are overweight. That&#8217;s puts us in the majority (by a long shot). Skinny people need to catch up with the times.</p>

The fashion industry is so far beyond insane it&#8217;s horrifying.  Models are walking coat hangers.  To quote Yves ST Laurent in Women&#8217;s Wear Daily (late 80s, if I recall correctly) &#8220;we want the models thin so their bodies don&#8217;t interfere with the clothes&#8221;.  Now, the clothes are supposed to be for women to wear, so clothes that look good on normal bodies would make sense, right?  No.  Clothes are art, independent of who will wear them, and YSL&#8217;s ideal was a body so thin it didn&#8217;t effect the hang of the garment.<br />
Folks, please speak up!  Contact magazines *and especially manufacturers* and say no more!  Insist on realistic clothes, sizing and labeling.  &#8220;Plus&#8221; is absurd, just give a numbered size and leave it at that.  Fat women know we&#8217;re fat, there&#8217;s no need to further ghettoize us.  If you can&#8217;t cut clothes for bodies that have more than two dimensions, make paper dolls.</p>

She&#8217;s not fat, she&#8217;s not overweight, but she IS exceptionally broad shouldered and has wider than average hips. She has a plus sized bone structure. I could be morbidly obese on my frame and still be too small to fill out &#8220;plus sized&#8221; clothing because plus sized clothing is not designed for &#8220;fat people&#8221; it is designed for people with a larger frame. You can be wear plus sized clothing and still be beautifully fit and healthy, and you can wear regularly sized clothing and still be obese. It has to do with skeletal frame, not body fat.</p>

Not once did I say it was scientifically proven.<br />
I can say, however, that it is scientifically proven that 97.58 adults out of every 100,000 people has a thyroid condition. That doesn&#8217;t explain the fact that over 60% of the US population is obese, and over 5% are morbidly obese (BMI 40% or higher). Not to mention the fact that obesity-related complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure, ulcers, and heart disease, cost taxpayers more per year than cigarettes. That&#8217;s right: purposely inhaling carcinogens is less harmful than being fat.<br />
Please tell me all about ignorance though. </p>

Why is one person just simply a model, while she is a PLUS sized model. Why is it necessary to make a size distinction. Its the same thing as saying &#8220;That guy..&#8221; versus &#8220;That Black guy&#8230;&#8221; Why is it necessary to make that distinction? Why can&#8217;t she just be called a MODEL and THATS IT?? An din fact, &#8220;plus size&#8221; DOES imply that it means &#8220;fat&#8221;. Have you ever walked into  a clothing store and gone into the PLUS section? Those clothes are sizes 20, 24, XXXL, etc. This woman is by no means a PLUS sized model and even if she was, why does the word PLUS have to come into play at all?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2114" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>1. Who said and why do modelling ads have to convey reality? Your own fault for thinking those images are the standard to society. Look at men magazines, or even many women magazines, every time you see a male, he is completely chizzled in every muscle group, do men get mad and think women expect that when thats all you see in every movie and picture? No. not at all. We dont think that way, neither should you.<br />
2. Stop hating and being mean to skinny girls because of your made up imperfections. Everyone is beautiful. Every curve is beautiful. You are beautiful. Many women claim that they are a &#8220;real woman&#8221; and they dont want to look like a twig and please society-Then why do you always try to diet? Why do you want to loose weight? You should EMBRACE your body no matter the size, and not try to change it. IF you want to change your body for your OWN reasons, GREAT! But don&#8217;t you go being condescending and be an absolute ass face to those girls you want to look like, and try to belittle them. Believe it or not, just like many girls are naturally larger, many girls are naturally small. Why is it ok to call a bigger girl beautiful and real, and a smaller one anorexic and disgusting?<br />
3. Don&#8217;t be rude to other girls because you&#8217;re jealous. Pretty self explanatory.<br />
Sorry for this long status, but I had to voice my opinion. What triggers me most is that after the article, HUNDREDS of girls were commenting and saying how stupid a very professional modeling company was and how all there girls are this and that and unbelievable and ugly and they are what girls really looked like. GIRLS, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL! Absolutely no one is telling you that this is what we expect a woman to look like! THE MODELS don&#8217;t even look like that! Think about it, if everyone looked like that fabricated beauty, then everyone would be a model. Big, small, short, tall you are all unique and gorgeous. Please stop conforming and yelling at society because of your insecurities and jealousy. They are miss-placed, no guy cares that every magazine has ripped guys and girls idolize them.<br />
Don&#8217;t blame society, you are society.<br />
Don&#8217;t hate and be ridiculously mean.<br />
Be true to yourself.<br />
Know you&#8217;re beautiful.</p>

And if she is, what does that mean for most of the rest of us? How big does that make us?</p>

I am about 5&#8217;6&#8243; and weigh 150, I have almost an identical body to this model and I&#8217;m not taking this offensively. I realize Cosmo didn&#8217;t mean to call anyone fat nor did I say that I agree with this classification. In fact what I said was this is a sad reality of the modelling world. I&#8217;m sorry that it effected your girlfriend that way and I&#8217;m sure it will offend other girls but we really shouldn&#8217;t take this is so seriously when these are impossible standards set by the modelling industry which is a completely different world. No need to insult me for defending the magazine, by point is they didn&#8217;t determine whether or not this girl was plus-size, she&#8217;s already classified as such in her line of work. I realize if I was a model I would be plus sized . . it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re fat it&#8217;s just an impossible standard set by an industry that unfortunately admires body types that aren&#8217;t the norm. I&#8217;m happy the modelling industry has changed over the years to at least accept normal girls like myself as models, about ten years ago the women in the picture would have been turned away and told to lose some weight. My whole point is that the modelling industry is the one to blame for this, not cosmopolitan. Ellen also had a model on her show who she referred to as a &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; model and in fact had an entire discussion with her guest about being a plus-sized model and she didn&#8217;t recieve the criticism cosmopolitan is for posting something on facebook.</p>

PLUS sized means OVER the healthy and normal weight for your age or height. This woman is in no way shape or form overweight. Therefore, why in the world, is she being labelled a PLUS sized model??? Walk into a woman&#8217;s clothing store and go to the &#8220;Plus&#8221; section and look at the size of the clothes. Then tell me if she is considered &#8220;plus&#8221;. That&#8217;s what all the fuss is about &#8211; the fact that she&#8217;s being labelled as plus when she is not.</p>

And I dont know exactly where you got that idea about Plus Sized and health. Well&#8230;perhaps if you are large because some excess fat in your body, it might affect your health. But where is the point on arguing about that?<br />
Also, not working out or doing cardio plus eating pizza and stuff, might contribute to the flappy arms we see in the cute fatty in the picture.<br />
Again, diet and exercise doesnt make you a better person, its just a choice.</p>

Who cares WHAT size she wears? If she wears 12, great! If she wears 6, okay! But who cares??? Why does the fact that she wear a size 12 have any sort of significance at all anyways? Because she wears 12 that means we have to call her a plus? Who cares what sizes she wears. Plus, also does in fact imply &#8220;fat&#8221;, as plus means overweight or weighing more than the average amount. Plus, as the other commenter said, plus sizes are actually 18+.</p>

The modelling world and agencies are the ones who classify who is and isn&#8217;t a plus size model. It&#8217;s sad that this is what is considered plus size when in reality she looks like a normal girl, thin even. But cosmo aren&#8217;t the ones who classified her as such, its just the sad reality of the modelling world. Sure, they could have just referred to her as a model rather than a plus sized one, but what difference does it make when in her every day job she&#8217;s referred to as a plus size model. . just like how other jobs have classifications such as doctor or nurse.</p>

Their bodies aren&#8217;t an insult to others, so the outrage it produces seems silly.</p>

Have you ever seen a Calvin Klien underwear model add? Those men have body fat percentages of 10% plus muscle. Men are also photoshopped. Men also are constantly exposed to hard to obtain body images. We don&#8217;t bitch. We dont make a topic of conversation over these issues every day. We just have more confidence and dont feel the need to fight the media. If you want to be part of that small percentage of people who are in bikini adds, then you better be ready to kill yourself in the gym. If not let them be skinny, and you be you. Stop giving a shit.</p>

Obviously she is stunning, but with society today, Yes, she is considered a plus size. And I can agree to that. I&#8217;m not saying she is &#8216;fat&#8217; or &#8216;obese&#8217;. She is gorgeous! That is MY opinion and I will stick to it. To each, his/her own.  Beauty, however, doesn&#8217;t come from size though. Everyone who has a few pounds to shed obviously gets offended because they&#8217;re insecure. Heck, I was. Last year I weighed 180 lbs. I dropped 30lbs in a few months and fit back into my high school jeans and i&#8217;m still loosing! If you&#8217;re so wrecked over your size/weight, then why not do something about it instead of complaining and crying over it. It&#8217;s better to bring health and fitness into your life, because you are worth it and you feel great doing it! And well, because the opposite results aren&#8217;t too ideal for your self-esteem or you altogether. But, If you are happy and feel great at whatever size you&#8217;re at, then GOOD! keep doing that. Robyn doesn&#8217;t care what size she is. She obviously looks and feels great! She&#8217;s not concerned about labels.</p>

throwing around the stats about over weight Americans I would encourage you to<br />
consider the following:  The &#8220;plus sized&#8221; model pictured above<br />
is not overweight (according to the cdc a bmi of 25-29 is overweight.  She<br />
is a least 5&#8217;9&#8221; which means she can weigh up to 168 lbs and not be considered<br />
overweight.  Also bmi does not take into account body fat percentage so it<br />
is a far from perfect measure of an individual’s risk of obesity related health<br />
problems.  Additionally, a body fat percentage of 19-22 is considered<br />
healthy for an adult woman).  Furthermore, women who look like the model<br />
above are not the ones coming into doctors’ offices requiring treatment for<br />
diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and all of the<br />
other things that come with being dangerously overweight.  Please stop<br />
categorizing women with any amount of body fat as fat/ overweight/ obese.<br />
 There is a whole spectrum of body type that ranges from the very thin to obese.<br />

It does not. &#8220;Plus size&#8221; merely refers to the number size the person wears. This model wears a size 12. That is a plus size. You do not have to be obese to wear plus sized clothing. It just so happens that most people who wear plus sized clothing are overweight. She just happens to be 6&#8243;2&#8242;.</p>

throwing around the stats about over weight Americans I would encourage you to<br />
consider the following:  The &#8220;plus sized&#8221; model pictured above<br />
is not overweight (according to the cdc a bmi of 25-29 is overweight.  She<br />
is a least 5&#8217;9&#8221; which means she can weigh up to 168 lbs and not be considered<br />
overweight.  Also bmi does not take into account body fat percentage so it<br />
is a far from perfect measure of an individual’s risk of obesity related health<br />
problems.  Additionally, a body fat percentage of 19-22 is considered<br />
healthy for an adult woman).  Furthermore, women who look like the model<br />
above are not the ones coming into doctors’ offices requiring treatment for<br />
diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and all of the<br />
other things that come with being dangerously overweight.  Please stop<br />
categorizing women with any amount of body fat as fat/ overweight/ obese.<br />
 There is a whole spectrum of body type that ranges from the very thin to obese.<br />
 Just because a women does not fit into the very thin category does not<br />
mean she is in the obese category.  Yes American&#8217;s in general are<br />
overweight and their health suffers because of it but the model above is not an<br />
example of that.</p>

If you feel that way when you see something like that thats your own fault, stop reading it. The reason you should read or do anything in life is to inspire yourself. Also these people are models, if you want to spend a couple hours a day for a couple years to look as good as this girl does then go ahead and do it, stop complaining about the media. They&#8217;re not the say-all and end-all of how you think. The magazine and their editors are so far removed from you, they certainly shouldn&#8217;t make you feel bad about yourself.

I know it and I am planing on doing something about it, but no one person can say to another that you are fat because that one person doesn&#8217;t know the health issuse of the other. Like me for example I have major thyriod issuses and arthritis. it makes it very hard to get moving. I think the women is healthy and looks beautiful. To be honest true beauty come from within and how we treat eachother. I would never voice my opinion about how someone looks with out being asked by that person because I don&#8217;t know there story. I know a girl in school who everyone picked on because she didn&#8217;t take care of herself. she was over weight, didn&#8217;t shower or brush her hair. I tried to help her. Come to find out many years later she way being molested by her mom&#8217;s boyfriend and her mom allowed it. That girl didn&#8217;t take care of herself because she didn&#8217;t want to be attactive to her mom&#8217;s boyfriend. So what I&#8217;m saying is unless you know the persons story you should really keep you mouth shut.</p>

<p>She is CONSIDERED plus-size in the modeling world, and in the real-world also. This saying, no one ever said she was &#8216;fat&#8217; as that is a term that inaccurately placed and used in our society. If anyone looks up her measurements, they would realize that she IS in-fact plus-sized, and pretty tall. She also has a lot of mass!! Her measurements are actually very different from the standard and usual measurements that other Victoria&#8217;s Secret models have. This is a triumph for her! Just because she maintains all of this curviness in a way that is appealing, is very beautiful and is a tactful model that understands how to give a camera the most eye-pleasing picture, it does not mean that she can not be considered plus-sized. You all are all looking way too into this. This is Victoria&#8217;s Secret we are talking about. Like please, this is a HUGE step in the right direction if you ask me&#8230;. so don&#8217;t try to take away the positive connotations behind this announcement, and just say &#8216;good for her&#8217; and move on with your lives, because this literally will not affect you in any way in 2 hours, 2 days, 2 years or ever at all.</p>

No she is beautiful and talented not tactical, with her every picture is pleasing to the eye and every angle stunning. This is not a HUGE step but just another stride down a path that most the american public already know. To label her as a Plus Size model is wrong because simply out she isn&#8217;t and for a very well acclaimed company to do so is wrong. The fix is simple take out &#8221; plus size&#8221; and just leave model SuperModel Robyn Lawley is Beyond Sexy in this swimsuit shoot. @Victoria&#8217;s Secret !!!!</p>

Most people are short enough that it means they look wider. You do not have to appear fat to be a plus size. &#8220;Plus size&#8221; refers only to the number of the size the model is wearing. The word you are looking for isn&#8217;t &#8220;plus size&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;overweight&#8221;, probably even more &#8220;obese&#8221;. If the US wants overweight models, that&#8217;s fine, but don&#8217;t lambast a plus size girl because she isn&#8217;t as round as you want her to be.</p>

Not to mention you are considered plus size is you wear a size 12-24 and she&#8217;s a 14.  Because she&#8217;s tall, her weight is more evenly distributed, if you see a shorter woman walking around in a size 14 you&#8217;d see how drastically different she would carry her weight.</p>

You people cry that society is &#8220;perpetuating&#8221; an idea of women. Aren&#8217;t you doing the same thing? I laugh at how people are encouraged for their girth while are shamed for being thin. You&#8217;re basically going in a giant circle and doing the same thing you&#8217;re bitching about. It&#8217;s mean to say &#8220;You&#8217;re fat&#8221; but it&#8217;s acceptable to say &#8220;eat a hamburger&#8221;. THAT is what is screwing up society, the fact that some of you don&#8217;t realize that BOTH are wrong. And just before you ever make yourself sound stupid ever again, some people are with high metabolic rates or other health characteristics that cause them to lose weight quickly. Some people are born and can hardly gain a pound while others can hardly keep them off. Accept both kinds of people (until it becomes a health concern). Please consider this before you post about how &#8220;disgusting&#8221; models are and cry about your idea of beauty not being recognized. Also, the fact that you rely so heavily on a magazine&#8217;s perception of beauty made me applaud you. That leaves a weak personality with most of the blame for this. Take charge of your own ideals and stop letting others make them for you.</p>

<p>But to be extremely clear (as you have indicated is painfully necessary for me to be)&#8230; To me, being a feminist (which I am) means that I believe women&#8217;s lives should be led by their own independent choices.

There are women of all shapes and sizes who deserve to be recognized as beautiful as well because they are all EQUAL. Fat women, discriminated against and oppressed by society, don`t get the chance to show their beauty and be accepted for what they look like. I know so many fat women that are comfortable with how they look and would love to be involved with the fashion industry. A plus-size model shouldn`t have to be &#8220;well-proportioned&#8221; (a thinner waist) to be considered beautiful, fat woman should have the chance to chase their dreams and not be oppressed by the fashion industry and society. Considering other plus-size models have thin, hourglass figures like this particular model, you can see that fat women of different shapes are still being oppressed, shamed and portrayed by the media as if they don`t exist. Plus size models should be more than a dress size&#8230; They should ALSO be fat women &#8211; women with DIFFERENT BODY TYPES &#8211; getting the chance to be involved in the fashion industry.</p>
<p>NO HUMAN DESERVES TO BE TREATED LESS OR IGNORED BECAUSE OF HOW THEY LOOK. Human cruelty can be unreal. Larger groups of privileged people that fit the mold (look how society tells them they should look; skinny, hourglass, etc.) preying on people that do not&#8230; The reality is that no single human is better and deserves to be treated better &#8211; acknowledged more -than any other person.</p>

On the other side of the coin, her visual proportions are considered standard for regular society, and some do see the term &#8220;plus-size&#8221; as a lighter way of being called overweight.</p>
<p>People shouldn&#8217;t be bashing Cosmo for posting the photo and stating the she is plus-size, it is not them deciding it. And the only reasons as to why she is plus-size are that she wears larger clothes and that she is heavier than the modelling standard. People need to think before they jump to a quick conclusion.</p>

<p>By most conventions this would indeed make her &#8220;plus-size&#8221; (Wikipedia defines plus-size as women&#8217;s sizes 12 to 24, and with more voluptuous figures) &#8230; but she is obviously *NOT* a fat woman; she is a tall, well-proportioned, beautiful woman, who happens to fall into the &#8220;plus-size&#8221; category.</p>
<p>&#8220;Standard&#8221; size clothing is generally designed from women ranging from 5&#8217;4&#8243; to 5&#8217;8&#8243; and sizes 4-14. &#8220;Petite&#8221; clothing is generally designed for women ranging from 5&#8217;0&#8243; to 5&#8217;4&#8243; and sizes 0-8, with fewer curves.</p>
<p>By implying that calling her plus-size (which she is) is calling her fat, you are perpetuating the negative connotations that the phrase &#8220;plus-size&#8221; was intended to downplay.</p>
<p>Shame on the industry? Perhaps. </p>
<p>Shame on you? Definitely.</p>

It is not healthy to be too skinny or too fat. There shouldn&#8217;t be support behind either side of it &#8211; we should be encouraging healthier lifestyles and self-acceptance of our body types. We shouldn&#8217;t be fat- or thin-shaming, nor should we promote obesity by overeating or being skinny by under-eating.</p>

Dr. Phil (I know we are all tired of Dr. Phil) had this girl on today who is doing something different. How about chewing your food for the flavor and then spitting it out! She believes that you will not gain weight that way but you still gain the great flavor. And Dove tried to tell us that we are ALL beautiful no matter what we look like. That is true! What happened to those commercials? We talk out of the corners of our mouths. One side says Be yourself and quit trying to be skinny. While the other side still wants the very, very, skinny to model on the bill boards. Ever watch &#8220;Project Runway&#8221; ? When I was young I had a very hard time gaining weight. You would not believe how people made fun of me. From neighbors to school mates! Right down to my future in-laws. Now a days It&#8217;s called bullying! Funny how &#8220;fat&#8221; people can make fun of &#8220;skinny&#8221; people and hurt them to the core and leave them with scars. But say one thing to a fat person, and Lord save us we&#8217;ll go to hell some day for being so mean. In later years I found out my thyroid was out of whack and after having my para thyroid removed my metabolism dropped so fasted I was in the I.C.U. for a couple of days. After that the pounds started to add up :(. Then people started to tell me I was fat! You know YOU CAN&#8217;T WIN FOR LOOSING!</p>

<p> FIRST: Sizes for women are not standardized due to manufactures not agreeing and women complaining about being &#8220;too big&#8221; if they were above average.</p>
<p> SECOND: &#8220;PLUS&#8221; Refers to a womans height in some cases, being over average in others. !!!!!!!  5&#8217;7&#8243; and over is PLUS. Average is 5&#8217;4&#8243;. In this article..it WAS refering to height. SHE&#8221;S 6 FOOT FRACKING 2!! 180lbs!! THATS PLUS BASTARDS!!</p>
<p> THIRD: Sizes have changes over the years as you idiots freak out over being a 10 or 12 so instead they changed it to a 6-8&#8230;you are still the same size. You just feel &#8220;better&#8221; and definately more entitled. Google &#8220;vanity sizing&#8221;.</p>
<p> Fourth!: NO GUY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD DATES A GIRL BY DRESS SIZE! If you are hot, youre hot. If not, not. Seriously, when was the last time a dude walked up and was like&#8230;&#8221;Yo, babe&#8230;what dress size are you?&#8221; Cause guys give two craps.</p>
<p> FINALLY:  But your insecutities and vanity are sure as hell making you less attractive to men everywhere.</p>
<p> If you have an issue with the way you look, hit the gym, not the computer.</p>
<p> Oh and if you&#8217;re wondering if I find the girl in question, Robyn Lawley, 6&#8217;2&#8243; 180lbs attractive&#8230; 10/10 would bang.</p>

The argument isn&#8217;t whether the model is or is not TECHNICALLY &#8220;plus-sized&#8221;, the argument is that calling someone who visually looks healthy and thin a &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; model is beyond confusing to the women and especially girls who look at these models and are told repeatedly that they&#8217;ll never measure up to her unless they are equally thin and beautiful. It tells girls who are larger than this model that, regardless of what they think about themselves, they are large.  And until you have the experience of growing up in a culture that repeatedly tells you how you look is not good enough, you will continue to be ignorant and think that telling girls to like themselves is the message they&#8217;ve been lacking. They know they SHOULD like themselves. They also know that their culture is telling them repeatedly that they are only supposed to like themselves if they&#8217;re thin and beautiful, and if they&#8217;re not, they have to change. THAT is the point being made here.</p>

We live in a society where we say to everything &#8220;yes&#8221;.Gay rights movement, feminism, multiculturalism, you name it, isn&#8217;t everyone in this country who has a little bit of history being oppressed taught to be exalting their &#8220;individuality&#8221;? Their ever so precious yet crooked &#8220;individuality&#8221; deserves so much attention that it gives them the opportunity to turn around and rebuke the societal norms that have been existing for almost the entire human history. What, now the lazy females are attempting to reverse even the natural norm and believe that your blind logic is going to win you some &#8220;sympathizers&#8221;? I do not advocate for unhealthy industrial propaganda, but I certainly won&#8217;t appreciate lazy fat chicks who dream of the reversal of nature. There is a thing called gym.</p>

Second, since when is oppressing any group of people a good thing to uphail? What has that ever given to a society other than hatred and brutality? Its not like those things you mentioned is harming anyone. In the end there will still be bigger and smaller women  in the world. The idea is to acknowledge a larger group of that they are all just women, not big or just small women but just female. Women ned to stop being pitted against each other with these labels.</p>
<p>Next&#8230;both bigger and smaller women are found to be attractive to the opposite gender, just because you dont like something doesnt mean everyone in the world doesnt as well. Turns out skinner women are sending signals of increased fertility or optimal fertility whereas bigger women are signaling ambition(since androgens make your waist to hip ration larger and tend to lead to  more competitive behavior) and more resources (since clearly they have enough to store fat.)So&#8230;during a time era where guys were suppose to bring home all the bacon it made sense there was a larger preference for skinny. Now that its more acceptable for women to do so it would only make sense this shift could occur.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1933" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Just an add on to bring up some points!</p>
<p>There is a minimum height for models that I believe is 5&#8217;7&#8221;, actually (it probably depends on the company or whatever) and to be considered a &#8220;petit&#8221; model you should be between 5&#8217;4&#8221; and 5&#8217;6&#8221;. Yes she is extremely tall, which is why she makes 180lbs so attractive, but for a woman of that height, 180lbs is considered about average (if not on the higher end of it!) range according to a few different searches, not above for her weight. So&#8230;she is not above on weight scale but in actuality very normal. It is EXTREMELY rare for a model to be within &#8220;average&#8221; weight range for their weight/height ratio, which is why I find this sort of cool. Yes she looks relatively thin because she has more places for her excess weight to go, I think it&#8217;s sort of great how the modelling industry is starting to see the negativities of the extremely thin and are starting to hire more &#8220;average&#8221; and healthy looking (as far as weight goes) models.</p>
<p>And yes, she DOES shop in the plus-sized section. Do you realize how hard it must be to find clothes for a 6&#8217;2&#8221; woman that still look cute? Your jeans have to be significantly longer and same with shirts if you want to cover your mid-section. &#8220;Plus-sized&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily equal &#8220;overweight&#8221; all of the time! <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> We live in a world where women are an average of 5&#8217;4&#8221;-5&#8217;7&#8221; and weigh around 115-130lbs on an average scale. I understand the problem with heavier women not being represented in the fashion world, as my mother struggles significantly with her weight being 5&#8217;0&#8221; and being considered obese has it&#8217;s major struggles, but isn&#8217;t it better to tailor clothing and such to people who are within a very healthy weight range? I don&#8217;t know, I feel like sometimes we all step on eggshells a little too much when it comes to being &#8220;overweight&#8221;. </p>
<p>Also realize that the fashion industry isn&#8217;t necessarily about the models, but the clothes the models are wearing.</p>

If we had some sort of malnutrition problem in America, I would feel concerned about this ad, but in reality, most of us serve ourselves more food than we should have, consume far more resources than what we need to survive and stay healthy. America is a fat country and if you think this cosmo ad is what is wrong with our society, you got your s**t twisted.</p>

Frankly some of these commentors are overreacting about the word &#8220;plus size,&#8221; because they&#8217;re &#8220;real/normal/healthy&#8221; we see plus size models and criticize the very idea that they are &#8220;plus size women&#8221; and pat ourselves on the back for acknowledging a beautiful woman who doesn&#8217;t fit the very thin image. That still doesn&#8217;t stop society from throwing stones and humiliating people who are considered &#8220;obese&#8221; by staring/shaming/snickering at them, filming them from the neck down and airing their bodies on national television (without their consent) to show the world that fat is so bad that these men and women should be ashamed to even show their faces in public. The plus size models are used as a guideline of acceptable fatness, just big enough to deviate from the normal model image, but not so big that likely won&#8217;t be disrespected due to their size. Body image issues SUCK.</p>

First of all, I think the vast majority of you all do not understand what the term &#8220;plus-sized supermodel&#8221; means.  In the modelling business, there are specific standards that these women have to meet, such as height, weight, and bodily structure.  If a model does not meet these standards and, such as in Lawley&#8217;s case, happens to be slightly larger, they are labeled a &#8220;plus-sized model&#8221;.  This is referring to the MODELLING INDUSTRY, not the average girl in today&#8217;s society!  Lawley is &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; in comparison with the standard high fashion model, but not in comparison with the average person.  All you ladies need to realize the context in which this term is being used before allowing it to offend you so greatly.</p>

So all the women who are about average look at that, do TAKE it personal. This is how women get a negative body image in their heads.

It says that smaller sizes are better.  Tell me that you or any of your girlfriends have not compared themselves to models and wished they were as skinny as said model.  Separate standards or not, the average woman will continue to compare themselves because that&#8217;s just how our society has molded them to think.  As a male, I think its bullshit because then guys have to constantly reassure their girlfriends that they are perfectly fine as they are.</p>

However, in the fashion industry, nothing is normal and average. Most models are significantly smaller than the average woman and I believe when they label a model as plus sized they are referring to the average model standards. For this reason she is unfortunately put in the &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; category. I don&#8217;t believe that Cosmo is really to blame here. I think this is a magazine adhering to the fashion rules, just like magazines everywhere do. I would not be surprised to see Vogue editors agree with this classification. The main issue and people to blame come from designers and modeling agencies that have created the unattainable image that in turn creates a beautiful woman like this to be deemed plus sized.</p>

<p>You also have to understand the meaning of proportion when referring to sizes &#8211; she could still be plus-sized and have an hourglass figure even though she might weigh 200 lbs. </p>
<p>Lastly, she is okay-looking but not &#8220;drop-dead gorgeous&#8221; in this photo, unless you like heads that appear too small for their bodies. I also find a longer waistline and a shorter hip height more proportionally attractive in a female, but that&#8217;s my artistic eye.</p>

A plus sized model in my personal opinion should be a size 14+ however society is so narrow minded that it starts them at a size 10! The average woman size in the US is a 14 after all. I truly appreciate the models that have paved the way in being full figured and keeping an active modeling career, Thank you Ashley Graham, Fluvia Lacerda, Viktoria Manas, Tara Lynn and many more&#8230; if you don&#8217;t know these gals google them, you&#8217;ll see a difference.   Every woman is beautiful and deserves to be accepted, end of story.</p>

The funny thing is that feminists actually promote a deteriorating society in branding women as more independent than they actually are which is statistically untrue. The only thing &#8220;crazy feminists&#8221; want is for more power for women as opposed to having the rights to obligations that men have to put up with (and no, military action is not an obligation). This being said, men are definitely hurting in the process which women apparently don&#8217;t care about which is quite ironic but then again, that&#8217;s probably what they want. Feminists are blinded by envy, hate on me all you want but this author did a superb job and hilariously enough gave herself more credibility by stating that she is, in fact, not crazy.</p>

 I support the whole &#8220;realistic bodies in advertising&#8221; movement, Robyn<br />
Lawley is a size 16.  She&#8217;s also proportionate, because she&#8217;s 6&#8217;2&#8243;, and<br />
drop-dead-fucking-gorgeous, but that doesn&#8217;t make her any less plus<br />
sized.  If &#8220;normal women&#8221; are freaking out over seeing her body in an<br />
advertisement for a &#8220;big girl store&#8221; because they think that means the<br />
world thinks they&#8217;re fat (as the article and &#8220;favorite facebook comment&#8221; are suggesting), they can get<br />
the fuck over themselves.  If bitches be a size medium at H&amp;M and<br />
think they&#8217;re fat then I&#8217;m not going to fall all over myself trying to<br />
convince them otherwise.<br />
On<br />
 the other hand, when I was a size 22 I didn&#8217;t appreciate browsing the<br />
Torrid website and seeing the clothes modeled by girls who looked like they were<br />
 a size eight, so I can sympathize too.</p>

Being a size 16 at 6 feet tall is NOT plus sized. Being a size 16 and 5 feet 4 inches is plus sized. That is really something people need to wrap their minds around.</p>

<p>While I would never look at this model and think of her as &#8220;plus size,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to place all of the blame on Cosmo as I&#8217;ve seen many blogs and statuses doing the past few days. The reality is that in the fashion industry, models size 8 (even sometimes 6) and up are considered plus size and I think that Cosmo simply chose their wording based on those guidelines. And while I completely agree that this model is nowhere near plus size, perhaps talk of reforming the fashion industry as a whole might prove to be much more useful than attacking Cosmo specifically. And I think Cosmo did a decent enough job addressing this in a different post on January 11th:<a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_mobile/celebrity/news/plus-sized-models" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_mobile/celebrity/news/plus-sized-models</a>. But as a side note, I keep seeing outraged statuses pondering how she could possibly be considered plus size as &#8220;she&#8217;s beautiful&#8221; (and she obviously is very beautiful). But does this imply that she would be considered less beautiful if she wore a larger size that you agreed to label &#8220;plus size&#8221;? I did not realize the term &#8220;plus size&#8221; was equivalent to &#8220;ugly&#8221; or &#8220;fat.&#8221; I don&#8217;t necessarily consider plus size to have a negative connotation and maybe eliminating this term completely, rather than continuing to differentiate between different types of people based on body shape and size, might be a step in the right direction.</p>

In fact for many women size 0 means underweight. The majority of supermodels have (had now that Milan has instituted minimums due to health concerns) a BMI of 18 or less. The DSM used to categorize the mental illness anorexia nervosa using a 17.5 BMI. Anything under 18.5 is considered clinically underweight. Personally I think BMI is a bunch of bs because it doesnt account for the difference between muscle mass and fat but it proves my point. The idea is not to accept obesity, its to accept yourself under healthy conditions and to love yourself for who you are, not what you look like. Also the word you are looking for is obese, you&#8217;re the one who seems obsessed with being thin.</p>

It is possible to be athletic and thin. The body&#8217;s musculature responds to the specific training. An Olympic sprinter and an Olympic marathoner look completely different. Both are athletes, both are healthy.  I am a marathon runner. I run ten to twelve miles per day, six days per week (60-66 miles per week)in addition to Barre and Pilates exercises. I eat thousands of calories per day. I too, have a six pack. I compete in marathons, and I have won marathons. I am 5&#8217;5&#8243; tall. Oh, and I am a size zero.</p>

<p>Seriously though, ladies, fuck Cosmo and its other knock-offs. They plant those insecurities in your head so that you&#8217;ll buy their magazines. Ignore that shit. If you feel the need to make a change because you think it would improve you, then do it. If you feel the need to make a change for the approval of others, well, that&#8217;s a choice for you to make. As a 220 pound 5&#8242; 10&#8243; male, I understand what it&#8217;s like to choose between the ability to pick up a tipsy chick at a club and the irresistible allure of a ribeye. I&#8217;m pretty happy with my choice, and that&#8217;s what counts.</p>

There should be more &#8220;average&#8221; sized woman in magazines like her. I think this girl is absolutely gorgeous, and I&#8217;d rather see someone her size on a magazine cover than most of the skinny girls they usually feature. She reminds me of Raquel Welch&#8230;.who was the sex symbol back in the day&#8230;see back then women in the media weren&#8217;t encouraged to be painfully skinny, they were average sized. We really need something done about that today!</p>

She is a model, that is that. Why are models who are very thin, very tall, (more than 1/2 who have documented eating disorders) called &#8220;super&#8221; models. They also should just be called a &#8216;model&#8217;. What makes one super and one plus? One is a healthy size and one is unrealistic for the majority of women&#8230; this woman isn&#8217;t plus anything. She should be referred to as a model &#8211; just as a 90 lb, 5&#8217;10 woman should be called a model, not a super model, just model.</p>

Adina, I understand where you&#8217;re coming from but Cosmo is not trying to shame women with their article. It&#8217;s not about being plus sized. It&#8217;s about a woman starting her own fashion line. Cosmo writers are not the ones who have declared her a plus size model. It&#8217;s the fashion industry who has. If you look, Cosmo also has this article which addresses the issue: <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/news/plus-sized-models" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/news/plus-sized-models</a></p>

Then trying to justify it. She is a bit over weight. Its just the truth.</p>

Plus Size has a negative connotation to it.  It implies that the model, while gorgeous, is some how not of a normal size and shape.  This girl is a total Glamazon, I mean she&#8217;s 6&#8217;2 and ridiculously beautiful, AND she has body proportions that are actually attainable!  Personally, I think we should ALL start saying Fiercly Real&#8230;so much more positive.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1796" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This woman is obviously very large.  Look at her head in comparison to the rest of her body.  It takes over two of them to span the width of her stomach.  She&#8217;s amazonian!</p>
<p>While I like to see women support each other no matter what size they are, I hate the &#8220;fat and proud&#8221; movement.  This model is clearly straddling the &#8220;healthy/overweight&#8221; categories in BMI.  Why is that not acceptable to people?  Why does she have to be super unhealthy to be considered plus-size?  Why do we, as a society, allow ourselves to settle for being larger sizes and then beg people to &#8220;love me for who I am&#8221;?  </p>
<p>I LOVE the image this model is portraying.  Looking at her, I suddenly feel like I&#8217;m not that far off from having a model figure and I feel motivated to just do a liiiiiiittle more exercise, and eat just a few more veggies. Full disclosure: I&#8217;m not in a healthy weight range.  But I&#8217;m not proud of it.  I KNOW I can take the inches off, but I&#8217;m too lazy to, just like many women in our country.  However, I will never allow myself to believe that being unhealthy is okay. (That&#8217;s my own battle&#8230; Being fat and knowing it but too lazy to do anything about it.)  </p>
<p>I think the problem isn&#8217;t this model, but rather it&#8217;s our culture telling us that to be beautiful, we have to be a size 0, and we eat that shit up.  And then, after we&#8217;ve cried into a carton of ice cream, we tell ourselves, &#8220;Screw that!  If you don&#8217;t like me for who I am, it&#8217;s your loss!&#8221;  If we had more models like her, I think we&#8217;d be more persuaded to set more realistic health goals.  She&#8217;s NOT thin!  But she&#8217;s certainly not fat. </p>
<p>The only way we&#8217;re going to change the modeling culture is by supporting her body type, and this picture!  We should WANT to see more of her so that the wind blows away all those toothpicks and SHE becomes the normal model figure.  That&#8217;s not going to happen if everyone kicks her to the curb and says she not good enough.  We&#8217;re basically telling the fashion world that they can keep their skinny models because we like to watch the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion show, but we&#8217;ll only accept size 0 and size 20 but nothing in-between. (As if people really want to see a size 20 model wearing the bikini this model is wearing.) </p>
<p>My point in all this is that I&#8217;m disappointed that people are shaming this picture.  It&#8217;s a really big step in changing our perception of beauty in this culture and we should be supporting it.</p>

Why do you think girls are starving themselves to be like the people they see on TV and in magazines? Why do you think people who are are overweight are made fun of everyday?  Why do you think men and women have unobtainable views of what is beautiful? The media.  They are the reasons why people define themselves from the outside. I hate that it matters what we look like, but it does; and women get the harsher end of that. Pick up any paper during the 2009 (not positive on that year) US Presidential Nomination and see how Hilary was described compared to the men. Media matters. Media sets the beauty standard. Take a class in media, language, culture, etc. and see this trend. It actually goes right along with racism, victimisation, hegemonic masculinity, sexism, etc.  Watch &#8216;Killing us softly 1-4&#8242; and see. </p>
<p>And I am real person. Your accusation that I am not is offensive.</p>

The modeling industry is the one who glamorizes super-skinny models.  Cosmo is not claiming this girl is plus-size, but in the supermodel industry, she is considered a &#8220;plus-size model&#8221;.</p>

The only way that could possibly be &#8220;over weight&#8221; is if she was pure muscle and solid as a fricken tree trunk. You clearly have no idea what you are talking about.  There is barely any chance a healthy woman who is almost 6&#8242; should be wearing size 2 clothing, which is what the modeling industry promotes.  That limited of a body fat percentage comes with plenty of medical problems, not to mention the psychological issues for thousands of people.</p>

So not to be rude but I would just like to point out that severe health complications come from being obese, which is not the same as overweight. The woman in the picture is overweight, she is heavier because of either too much water retention, her bone structure, or she could have a mild bit of extra fat. However, she is not obese. Obesity is when you&#8217;re body fat percentage is so high that it becomes a possible concern. HOWEVER, even when you are obese this does not guarantee any illnesses shall occur, you are just at a higher risk. Beyond this is morbid obesity when you&#8217;re body fat percentage is extremely high and your likelihood of a fatal or life changing illness is almost certain because of your weight. </p>
<p>The problem that you people seem to have is that you can&#8217;t tell the difference between these stages and treat women who are overweight like they are morbidly obese. While 70%  of Americans are overweight, only 7% are morbidly obese. </p>
<p>Stop being a part of the problem. Don&#8217;t judge women you don&#8217;t know on incorrect information and a country you don&#8217;t live in on stereotypes.</p>

From what I can see, I would estimate she is not overweight. In fact, from a brief search and calculation, she is 6ft 2in (1.88 meters) and apparently at her heaviest weighs 82.5 kilograms. BMI = mass(kg)/ (height (m))^2; therefore, her BMI is 23.5 which is easily within the healthy range (18.5-25). You are correct in that we shouldn&#8217;t encourage obesity, but you&#8217;re ridiculously off-the-mark by saying this woman is overweight. Giving a &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; designation to a woman with a perfectly healthy weight is the whole reason this is outrageous.</p>

She is likely more than the Hollywood average of 100#, but her size is absolutely proportionate to her height. What&#8217;s most important when determining overweight and unhealthy is waist size, a waist size of greater than 34inches is unhealthy and a risk factor of diabetes and heart disease.  This woman clearly has a thin waist, again likely more than the Hollywood average of 20inches, but smaller than the American average.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1790" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It&#8217;s clear that people are going to get their feelings hurt by your comment. However, I agree to the point you&#8217;re attempting to get at. There is no way to know her body fat percentage, or her cholesterol levels, or anything of that sort. That being said, however, it is a medical fact that being over-weight (and by over-weight I am meaning a body fat level which is considered unhealthy) leads to an extensive amount of health concerns. I feel that promoting &#8220;loving yourself and your body&#8221; and a realistic representation of American women is admirable, necessary, and fundamental for moving forward as a gender. HOWEVER, I do not feel that &#8220;loving yourself and your body&#8221; should mean that if you are at an unhealthy weight that you should simply expect everyone else to maintain that weight. There are supermodels who are underweight, they are &#8220;skinny fat&#8221; and just as unhealthy as their over-weight counterparts. The focus should be health. The industry focuses on those who are &#8220;thin&#8221; by whichever standard because, in theory, they are healthy, and health is attractive. Perhaps not always, but genetically speaking, the human species seeks healthy mates and those who are &#8220;in shape&#8221; are at a lower risk for all diseases, have better vitality and many other biological factors. </p>
<p>This does not have to be women against women. Over-weight women hating on thin women, and thin women talking crap on over-weight women. The conversation should not be how is she considered plus-size, but why is plus size such a dirty word? If America is wearing these clothes, they are this size, and they find this size appealing, why does it cause an outrage to be labeled &#8220;plus-size&#8221;.</p>
<p>Frankly, I believe more than any movement (self-love, fitspo, whatever), the focus should be on health. Whatever the height. Whatever the weight. The focus should be on eating right, and exercising. Maintaining a healthy body fat composition. I don&#8217;t feel that endorsing that it&#8217;s just ok to be over-weight, because well, all of America is, is at all healthy or helping. Nor is the idealistic expectation of being 5&#8217;11&#8221; and 115lbs like the majority of runway ladies. For the record, skinny-shaming isn&#8217;t helping anyone. Making skinny, or healthy, or even under-weight dirty and despicable is just as bad as the opposite. America has trouble finding the correct issue to be outraged about. You complain that this woman being labeled plus-size is insanity. To whom? And why? I&#8217;m not outraged. She apparently wears a size 12, which is considered by all standards plus-size. Are attractive and plus-sized mutually exclusive? Are &#8220;over-weight&#8221; and &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; synonyms? &#8230;. </p>
<p>I wish that we could focus on appropriate issues.</p>

Obviously &#8220;plus-size models&#8221; are similar or even slimmer than the average American woman. The difference is that the model agencies list women who are much taller than average and underweight by height/weight ratio as &#8220;fashion models.&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean that to say that fashion models are unhealthy, thought I&#8217;m sure that many battle with food-related issues seeing as how their careers depend on staying slim, but the bottom line is that they have a very different body type than the average woman. The trouble is that then the regular-size girls have the label of &#8220;plus-size&#8221; and the girls under 5&#8217;7&#8243; have the label of &#8220;petite&#8221; (try putting them in petite pants &#8211; HA!) and these do not correlate at all with the sizing of the general population. This is an industry-wide practice and this particular magazine really shouldn&#8217;t be taking the heat for it more so than any other business within the fashion industry.</p>

They don&#8217;t make &#8220;size 8 super tall&#8221; or whatever you&#8217;d want to call it. Don&#8217;t think that you can arbitrarily eyeball people&#8217;s sizes when you&#8217;re not considering height. She&#8217;s considered plus-size by modelling definitions because of the sizes she wears, not because the fashion police measured her BMI and declared her overweight.</p>
<p>With that said, C B is obviously a complete douchebag to overweight people, so it feels really awkward backing up his facts&#8230;. Still, though, his second sentence was, simply, fact.</p>

Regardless of that, I wore a 14 for a long time and never had to shop in the plus section.</p>

If you are saying it&#8217;s sick that this is plus sized because you must be super sized then&#8230;. perhaps it is time to re-evaluate your life and make necessary changes to obtain a healthy body weight.  Having models being an abnormal weight is not a new concept.  Maybe if all of these outraged females actually did something worthwhile with their time instead of bitching at an advertisement&#8230; things would get done.  You feed into your own disillusioned concept of an oppressive &#8220;Patriarchy&#8221; by letting yourselves focus energy on this nonsense.  You want equality?  Do something in pursuit of human rights then.  And additionally, if you are comparing yourself to magazine advertisements, it isn&#8217;t society that is fucked, YOU are the fucked up one.</p>

I just got finished re-reading Fahrenheit 451 and we were warned of the dangers of censorship in future society.  People want to bitch about being treated unfairly by society rather than attempting to better themselves and as long as that continues to happen, no progress will be made.  Look at the size of the average American over the last few decades- it is increasing RAPIDLY.  Does that mean we should become offended that our overweight society isn&#8217;t being mirrored in advertising, or does that mean we should take a look around and fix the problem? We are on the verge of a diabetes and obesity EPIDEMIC.  An epidemic, as if we cannot stop what&#8217;s happening.  The woman in this photo is overweight, aka plus-size, and the fact that many of you are complaining about that makes me realize that our country&#8217;s problem is more widespread than I thought.  i just hope everyone realize that if this woman is considered &#8220;thin&#8221; years down the line, that will mean sky-high insurance/health costs for every American.  It is scientifically not healthy to be overweight. Say what you want about the social issues at play</p>

<p>What&#8217;s funny is I&#8217;m seeing a lot of comments from men saying &#8216;don&#8217;t worry about this crap, she&#8217;s beautiful, other women are beautiful regardless their size,  getting worked up over this is hurting your self-esteem and a waste of time, be yourself.&#8221; And women are responding &#8220;NO! You&#8217;re the problem! There are unnecessary pressures, and women should be able to be themselves!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another knee-slapper  is all the women insisting the phrase &#8220;plus-sized model&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t be used because it&#8217;s degrading, but then going on to correct somebody about the proper use of the term when they say &#8216;well she is a size ___ so technically she&#8217;s bigger than the average model but that doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;s fat.&#8217;</p>

at between 6&#8242; and 6&#8217;1&#8243; and 160 lbs (exactly in the middle of the healthy weight range for our height, which ranges from 140 to 180) i was a size 10. she&#8217;s a tiny bit taller and maybe a tiny bit heavier. she&#8217;s probably a 12, and in the modeling industry (awful as it is), that is size 12. when i was down to 146 lbs i was a small size 8. they use taller models for plus-size because they look thinner by comparison. if you see a 5&#8217;4&#8243; woman and a 6&#8217;2&#8243; woman wearing the same size, the tall woman will look thinner. her height is her game in the plus-size modeling industry. they still get a thin model, but if she can wear a 12, they can use her to sell plus size clothes.</p>

At the same time we need to stop saying this is normal or average. I am 5 foot and weigh 125 lbs and have a lot of muscle mass and was still told by my doctor that I need to watch my weight because it was getting out of control. Historically as more food became available the American public ate more because that was what lavish culture told us to do. Consequently most of the American public changed its perception of what a normal woman should look like (those are the people outraged that she is considered plus size). Now magazines and the medical profession are sticking to their guns saying no you&#8217;re wrong, by standards that were set hundreds of years ago she is plus sized.  Truth is this woman weighs more than the average model. Truth is this woman weighs about the same as average women.  Truth is this woman had the courage to join a world that completely runs off of skinny people. That should be the only thing that matters. She had the courage to call herself beautiful. That is what everyone needs the courage to be beautiful whether their skinny or curvy or can see their toes or have stretch marks that aren&#8217;t from having kids. Society is suffocating courage not beauty. </p>

No one says it&#8217;s unattractive or unhealth.  This is about larger than larger than average, regardless of BMI</p>

People tell me I need to eat more. I am well built and muscular, but since I am so tall people look at me and think &#8220;string bean&#8221;. This woman is pretty much the same size as me, 1&#8243; and 5 pounds difference, and yet she is called a plus size model? Talk about double standards&#8230; Your assessment is categorically flawed by the way, Sure, she may be TALL by medical standards in America, however you&#8217;re taking the average woman, adding 9 inches and only 15 pounds. That&#8217;s less than 2 pounds per inch added to her size, making her, again, quite tall, but not at all &#8220;plus sized&#8221; which is typically a measurement that has more to do with girth than with height. Here are some pictures of your &#8220;average&#8221;, do they really look like this &#8220;plus sized&#8221; model? <a href="http://www.mybodygallery.com/search.html?gender=female&#038;height=165&#038;age=any&#038;weight=73&#038;pantSize=any&#038;shirtSize=any&#038;bodytype=" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybodygallery.com/search.html?gender=female&#038;height=165&#038;age=any&#038;weight=73&#038;pantSize=any&#038;shirtSize=any&#038;bodytype=</a></p>

I won&#8217;t spend money on a magazine that perpetuates this kind of nonsense. If magazines and companies want to continue this kind of nonsense, they are only going to loose more and more credibility as the average thinking individual can quickly and easily spot such bull. I for one hope they keep it up to the point they go out of business. That&#8217;s the future they have in store. My opinion of a beautiful woman, is one that&#8217;s not so skinny you can see her bones, and not one who&#8217;s so overweight that she can&#8217;t get out of a chair. Find a balance, to me sexy is healthy. Times are changing, it&#8217;s not about starvation to look your best anymore but eating healthily, and being healthy in body soul and mind. That&#8217;s sexy.</p>

What I do have a problem with is all the stories you hear about models being told they weigh too much when it is obvious they are waifs who are already on diets of lettuce and water. Naturally thin that is awesome, I was like that when I was young until my early 20&#8217;s I was a size 1 and I could NOT gain weight and was put on shakes just to try and put weight on I was constantly harassed about it and told to eat more. Its pretty pathetic when you have to shop in the kids section when your 21 because adult sizes don&#8217;t fit you. But I did eat and I did NOT starve myself like so many models and people who want to be thin because society makes it out so people who are not that perfect size are imperfect. What is fed to society as NORMAL is what is wrong. Now however I no longer have that issue, actually I am on the other end so either way you look at it it is quite annoying. Cindy Crawford is 5&#8217;9&#8243; , Tyra banks is 5&#8217;10&#8221;, Iman is 5&#8217;10&#8221;, Gisel is 5&#8217;11&#8221;, Kimora Lee is 6&#8217;0&#8243;, Brook Shields is 6&#8217;0&#8243; so its not about height. The list goes on and on.</p>

I understand that &#8220;plus size&#8221; in the modeling industry may mean something different, but not to any average girl who does not model. She looks like a HEALTHY model, notice you cannot see her bones and she appears to be fit and not &#8220;chunky&#8221;. I think &#8220;plus size&#8221; is a term that yes, may destroy society in a tiny bit&#8230;but maybe if their was a better explanation for it (not just the modeling industry definition because it is very misleading) it would not attract so much hype! This model is georgous and this is what girls should want to look like, but the whole &#8220;plus size&#8221; title she has makes society think its not what they want to strive for. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s not society that&#8217;s screwed up, we&#8217;re fine. We&#8217;re doing great actually. If you keep on sending the message that society is screwed up, that&#8217;s not helping anyone. It&#8217;s the MEDIA that has the power to control our perception of what we THINK. As long as you know the difference, as well as everyone else, that she is just as normal as the rest of us, there&#8217;s no need to freak. Don&#8217;t let cosmo, or any other huge media publication have the attention and the power to control what you think is pretty!

^^^^<br />
I&#8217;m showing you this because what we want isn&#8217;t what sells. We don&#8217;t have a choice in what&#8217;s advertised to us. Our opinions are essentially created for us through these publications because that is what will make THEM money. When was the last time Cosmo, or any other huge publication asked you what kind of lipstick you wanted to buy, or the correct measurements for a plus-sized model, or the kind of shampoo you liked? They don&#8217;t, they just make up the next big thing and sell it. They don&#8217;t CARE how their advertising will make us feel, but as long as someone&#8217;s buying into it, it works. And look! It is &#8211; because the amount of uproar from this one article means that someone, somewhere will be sold something. We don&#8217;t have a choice in making decisions like that cause it&#8217;s up to them. We don&#8217;t create the media, because if we did I&#8217;m sure it wouldn&#8217;t be as half as corrupt as it currently is &#8211; clearly people don&#8217;t &#8220;want&#8221; this. Their disgusted by it. But their still reading it. And the terrible part is, the way how you can finish your argument with &#8220;society is screwed up.&#8221; &#8211; You&#8217;re a part of society, where&#8217;s your solution to your problem? You are the solution to your own problem, be the change YOU want to see in the world. The more you keep buying into and believing these sick and twisted perceptions of what they WANT you to think, the more control they have over you to buy more things you think will make you feel beautiful. I won&#8217;t lie, society isn&#8217;t perfect, but we do have the power to resist and not buy into what the media wants from us. The greatest power we have is what we decide to do with our dollar, so save your money, because it will make your soul feel 100x better.</p>

Look to your right, there is an add telling you to shop for more clothes because the ones you currently have aren&#8217;t good enough. Screw the media because that&#8217;s what sucks. Society would do so much better if we didn&#8217;t buy into the greed.</p>

A comparison between athletes and models is pretty ill composed by nature, though.  Athletes focus on achieving a physical goal that allows them to perform well in a sport and it is known that they have to be in a certain physical condition to achieve their goals.  Models focus on achieving a physical goal (an often unhealthy one) that allows them to sell whatever is being sold and this means their bodies must fall within what our society deems will sell; our consumer culture buys into what models are doing and buys the product with the photoshopped, unrealistic body.  Most models don&#8217;t decide what job they&#8217;ll have or even what their bodies look like anymore&#8230;the higher ups do this and perpetuate the idea an ideal body that is not reflective of a normal body. (For an example of a normal body, look at this beautiful model above) I guarantee that if you talk to any woman who is of any weight, even a healthy or UNDERWEIGHT one, they will tell you that they are or have been at some point unhappy with their bodies because of seeing some advertisement in a magazine.  Why?  Because those women have been so photoshopped that NO ONE can look like them&#8230;but women and men alike are made to feel like they are the ideal of &#8216;beauty&#8217;.</p>

It is true, though, that if you saw this girl on the street you wouldn&#8217;t think of her as plus sized, even though she is a size 12, but that really isn&#8217;t that relevant. Companies are never going to use actual obese people to represent their product. They&#8217;re not usually going to use average looking people to represent their product. I don&#8217;t think there is anything wrong with this. They want the most attractive people they can find to represent their brand, and it works. It is just marketing. Honestly, when I look in a magazine, I want to see beautiful people. The woman in the picture is still a beautiful model, but she is larger than most models, and therefore labeled plus sized.</p>
<p>Also, I think there is a big issue with &#8220;skinny shaming.&#8221; Most models are not all &#8220;bones&#8221; like many people tend to say. They&#8217;re thinner than most people, but I don&#8217;t think the average model looks unhealthy. These women are paid to be thin, pretty, and work out a lot in order to look a certain way. It is their job, and they were hired because they have the ability to accomplish that. People saying that there is something wrong with being a size 0 or 2 need to take a hard look at what it is they&#8217;re doing. You can&#8217;t discriminate against one group of people in order to benefit another group who you think are being discriminated against. That is hypocritical and counter productive.</p>
<p>A lot of thin girls defend themselves by saying something along the lines of, &#8220;I&#8217;m a size 0 and I have never been able to gain weight!&#8221; They don&#8217;t need to gain weight, nor should they have to justify their weight. I&#8217;m naturally thin, but the truth is I could gain weight if I stopped working out and eating right, but why would I do that? No one should have to justify their weight, whether they&#8217;re big or small, and no one should comment on another person&#8217;s weight unless asked to do so by that person. When people think its okay to tell me that I&#8217;m &#8220;too skinny,&#8221; I always have to bite my tongue, because if I gave them an unsolicited assessment of their own physical health, I don&#8217;t think they would like it too much either.</p>
<p>Most Americans today are overweight, and if companies started using people of actual average size, then they would be promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. To the people that say that no matter how hard they worked out, they would never be as small as a model: no one is asking you to look like a model. You&#8217;re not a model. It&#8217;s not your job to look like that, so relax. As long as you&#8217;re happy and healthy, who cares whats in magazines?</p>
<p>Although the woman in the photo was labeled &#8220;plus sized,&#8221; that wasn&#8217;t put on her with a negative connotation. Those who were offended by Cosmo&#8217;s post are the ones who are saying that being plus sized is somehow a negative thing. Also, these people are indirectly saying that if only she were fatter, being labeled plus sized (which is apparently an insult) would be okay. None of this logic makes sense. The woman is a size twelve. She looks great. She is technically plus sized. She looks phenomenal and the rest of us can only wish we looked like that. Being plus sized and looking great aren&#8217;t contradictory, so people need to stop acting like they are.</p>

I guess you could call her plus sized in comparison to exceptionally petite women, but being exceptionally petite shouldn&#8217;t be the standard for beauty. Since plus sized means bigger wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense to reserve that kind of label for someone who is bigger than the average woman? I agree that as long as people are both healthy and happy labels found in magazines shouldn&#8217;t matter, but the media greatly influences people both consciously and subconsciously. </p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t like the idea of skinny shaming, that&#8217;s not any better than fat shaming. It&#8217;s true that being overweight is an unhealthy lifestyle to promote, but being underweight isn&#8217;t healthy either and magazines often promote that kind of body image. The so-called plus sized model in this photo is a great example of the kind of image that should be seen more often in magazines, and not under a plus sized label.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1668" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think models should reflect the size of society, meaning a mix of bigger boned models and skinny models. This women is naturally larger then most models at 6&#8217;2 and 180 pounds, but that doesnt mean she doesn&#8217;t work out as hard as normal models to retain her figure. I don&#8217;t believe people who are normal weight should be classed as plus-sized just because they are larger then a size zero. The problem is not being labled plus-sized, but creating crazy high standards for young girls to strive to be. no one is asking you to look like a model. You&#8217;re not a model. It&#8217;s not your job to look like that, so relax. As long as you&#8217;re happy and healthy, who cares what is portrayed in magazines? That is not what young girls take from magazines, as a 17 year old girl, I know the pain that young girls go through when they are trying to understand why they don&#8217;t look like Cara Delevingne. One of my childhood friends is currently recovering from anorexia, she was a size 8 (size 4 Usa), and thought she was too fat. Skinny shaming is there, and yes its just as terrible, but it&#8217;s not as endorsed by the fashion industry like &#8220;fat shaming&#8221;. They should get rid of the term &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; just as they should get rid of the term &#8220;petitie&#8221;. In Model standards a girl is plus sized if they are a size 10 or above (USA 6), and petite is a 5,8 or below. How many people do you know who are 6ft and a size 0. Now I&#8217;m not saying they should get rid of traditional models, and I&#8217;m definatly not endorsing &#8220;skinny shaming, I just believe all of society should be represented in fashion, meaning tall models, skinny models, short models, and larger models.</p>

Flawless skin, nobody ever has cellulite or wrinkles (unless you want to talk about those &#8220;problems&#8221;)&#8230; Super unrealistic.

There is just no argument about that one, but what&#8217;s more distressing is the people&#8217;s willingness to criticise and make others feel less than ideal based on their own perception of beauty. People saying that it&#8217;s only fat people who need to work out are upset by this, you are just plain ignorant. People are upset for the fact that her body image is seen as not the Norm, when a size 12 is perfectly normal size to be (depending on your proportions). Someone&#8217;s size does not determine how healthy a person is, just cos your a size 8 doesn&#8217;t reflect your fitness level in the slightest. Ultimately women need to get out of attacking each other over each others weight/size, it&#8217;s just ridiculous. It&#8217;s a matter of being healthy and aspiring to be a healthy size based on your body shape and proportions (not anyone else&#8217;s). </p>

(Fashion, Plus-Size, Petite, Mature, etc.) But yes, that is obvious without the magazine specifying what type of model she is. She is gorgeous and has a great body.</p>

Our obsession with appearances is the strongest indicator that we have not advanced any further than our own hormonal responses.  While we all would like to see people that are physically appealing, is it not enough to see them first as people, then as women or men, then as specific personality types, then as &#8216;appealing&#8217; or &#8216;unappealing&#8217;? Is it not more important that someone be &#8216;healthy&#8217;?  Can that be a new &#8216;size&#8217;?  &#8220;What size are you?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Healthy.  I&#8217;m healthy.&#8221;<br />
Or, maybe this:<br />
&#8220;A perfect ten.  A perfect 14.  A perfect 8.&#8221;<br />
Fashion trashzines are not the measure by which we are assessed.  We are.</p>

<p>Your assertions that labels delineating clothing lines into markets relating to size and shape cause harm to the self esteem of some population of women are ridiculous. There is no negative connotation to plus-size beyond the very contrived one you&#8217;ve imagined.</p>

If you&#8217;re reading these cosmo posts then you liked their page, it&#8217;s a very simple to unlike. Unfortunately many girls won&#8217;t even consider unliking, despite that being the only action that would really make a difference. For that reason I find it hard to sympathise with girls who voluntarily consume massive amounts of media that distress them, it just isn&#8217;t logical.</p>

<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is how people who are not growing up in this environment (which, in my opinion, is downright hostile to girls&#8217; psyche, especially regarding body image) can judge why these girls behave the way in which they do. While it doesn&#8217;t make logical sense for any girl to read this idiot magazine, you have no right to judge girls who have been conditioned from an early age to believe that the magazine has hard truths in it. Especially if you&#8217;re a guy. You have no idea. </p>

We are bombarded with the message that unrealisticness (for lack of a better world lol) is best. And it&#8217;s negatively affecting girls&#8217; body images  </p>

My point is this: it is getting to people because it is enormously detrimental to girls&#8217; body image in America.<br />
As an observer who has never felt what adolescent girls feel when they look at what is supposed to be their aspiration for body image in the media, which is EVERYWHERE, you cannot possibly understand how poisonous this is. You can&#8217;t possibly understand how horrible a girl feels when she comes to the realization that she will never be considered &#8216;beautiful&#8217; or &#8216;desirable&#8217;. If the media takes steps to reverse these ideals, girls would be able to grow up without such a damaged understanding of beauty and self worth.</p>

Being 6 foot tall 100 lbs and a size 0 which is what is expected in the modeling world is almost impossible to obtain, even if I worked out daily and cut out every bad thing I ate I would NEVER be able to reach that size because I have normal size hips like 90% of women do and by the way I am not &#8220;plus sized&#8221; and have always been thin but curvy!!

 I find your insulting response to this mother to be completely thoughtless and ignorant. A part of being in a career where you&#8217;re clearly in the &#8220;public eye&#8221; involves being an influence or to some extent, a role model to others; this is inevitable, don&#8217;t you think? And also, this is a SUPERMODEL (meaning she isn&#8217;t ignorant enough to overlook her position as an influence). As a supermodel, she obviously earned this title through hard work within the modeling field and is not oblivious to the malicious nature of society&#8217;s standards and it&#8217;s effects on girls all around. (so even if this mother taught her daughters to not be influenced by filthy magazines like Cosmo- you can&#8217;t always protect your children from what they are influenced by or what they see and you&#8217;re an idiot if you think differently)</p>
<p>Sure, no one is saying people, especially girls, should inspire to be as skinny as a size 0 (I also don&#8217;t want to insult naturally skinny girls out there, you&#8217;re beautiful too.) but at the same time, if we have &#8220;plus-size models&#8221; why don&#8217;t we add on &#8220;minus-size&#8221; models as well, so the demeaning of both body types is being shared?</p>
<p>and lastly,</p>
<p>&#8220;isn&#8217;t the guy who finished in last place in the 400 meter dash in the olympics considered slow compared to the guy who won?&#8221;</p>
<p>What a pathetic analogy, sure there is a winner and the loser is obviously slower, but they are clearly talented enough to be in the olympics. Sure, Robyn Lawley is the &#8220;slow guy&#8221; and the skinny model is the &#8220;winner&#8221; but can&#8217;t they be beautiful regardless of the distasteful harshness of the media? </p>

What is ignorant is calling Cosmo a filthy magazine as if they created this name plus-sized. What is also ignorant is saying that Robyn Lawley need not to &#8220;overlook her position as an influence&#8221; when she&#8217;s not doing anything outside of her career title to make her a bad influence. What she is doing, is her job. Are you going to protest the profession of modeling? They&#8217;re small for a reason, one of them being that it costs less money to clothe tiny people apposed to bigger people. You clearly don&#8217;t understand what the purpose of modeling is, to advertise products, not people. If you want to consider them role models, why don&#8217;t you look up to them as people who worked really hard to accomplish what they have accomplished.<br />
And yes you can teach your daughters to not to be influenced by &#8220;filthy magazines like Cosmo-&#8221; because that&#8217;s what my mother did. I&#8217;m 18 years old, a size 10, and even I not being the size of a model or even a plus sized model know that it is completely stupid and ignorant to blame models for the career they chose. If anything blame society for their view on models and each other for not understanding the difference between how society views models and how the modeling industry views models.<br />
Society can say Robyn Lawley is an image of health. But a designer who wants to save money on fabric will look at her and call her plus-sized because they&#8217;d have to use more fabric on her than they&#8217;d have to on Cara Delevigne.</p>

Since they have that influence (by the mere fact that they are EVERYWHERE in common life) it is wrong for them to define this girl as plus sized.</p>
<p>I would love to say that we should define beauty for ourselves. And we should. But that&#8217;s not realistic for girls in our society at large when the industry is shoving their standards of beauty down non-models&#8217; throats.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re doing it on purpose. They aren&#8217;t saying &#8220;let&#8217;s make these girls feel like dirt! Yeah!&#8221; it&#8217;s just a chain reaction of historical icons that have influenced what people think is beautiful. And I think th exclusivity of those opinions concerning beauty (and the media&#8217;s decision to perpetuate it all in the name of profit) is dangerous and shameful.</p>

<p>The problem with this whole thing is that the modeling industry&#8217;s definitions of average body type and beauty are projected onto us normal girls.</p>
<p>We can both agree that models are meant to exemplify beauty (advertisers want their products to be advertised in the most appealing way possible). If models are meant to exemplify beauty and most models are stick-thin, then we are necessarily concluding as a society that stick-thinness is the epitome of beauty. </p>
<p>The whole skinny model thing didnt even come to be until the 60s when everyone wanted to look like Twiggy. And modeling as a career existed long before that. </p>
<p>So the models did not come to be for their skinniness, but for their beauty. But now since we have equated the two (thinness and beauty) our society has this stupid complex that skinny is the ultimate beautiful body type EVEN AMONG us non-models. THAT&#8217;S  the problem with calling skinny models the average ones. </p>
<p>Victoria secret models are beautiful, but they are not average. You can&#8217;t act like the modeling industry&#8217;s standards are solely associated with models, because it&#8217;s not true. Us non-models have to deal with those (unrealistic) standards and it&#8217;s not accurate or healthy for our girls&#8217; body images.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1746" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>allow me to explain. bear with me this isnt an attack on your opinion but rather the post.. first off- you are focusing on the wrong word. you think &#8220;plus-size&#8221; and you probably think of honey boo boo&#8217;s bother having to wash herself with a rag on a stick and hasnt seen her intimate areas since the Clinton administration. The word you have to focus on is MODEL. This woman has no other job in life but to be beautiful. she is a professional who gets paid millions of dollars to do this.. sorry to anybody who is waiting for ugly and atrocious to come into fad. She is still a MODEL. If any plane jane or irregularly shaped person could make a cosmo spread or be a VS angel it wouldnt be special. As it is this woman probably had a very hard time getting into the industry to pursue her passion. Secondly- this chick is is plus size. where i stand at 5&#8217;7 155lbs i would bet every dime to my name that she is at least a head taller and 50lbs heaver than i am. THIS IS NOT NORMAL SIZE. Thus, PLUS size. think a woman over 6 ft tall and 200 lbs is a regular sized model? i think not. so if she cant be a regular model, and doesnt fit what you think is a &#8220;plus&#8221; model, please tell me what kind of model she is. People are just upset because theyre hearts are broken that every woman in america cant be a model. even though most of them think they are&#8230; I say nobody can complain until they put in at least as much effort and dedication to their body as she does&#8230;</p>

Imagining &#8220;feminism&#8221; means only the pretty things you want it to mean in near complete disregard of how it is lived, spoken, and activism-ed in practice is hypocrisy. No one genuinely interested in civil liberties for humans as a whole needs to define themselves by a term that, by name alone to begin with, segregates and specifies only one gender. This angle of argument has long ago lost whatever intellectual muster it had among mature ethical discussions that involve people who aren&#8217;t addicted to the proverbial kool-aid.</p>

I added my height as a way to show how skewed the modeling agency is when their petite models are bigger than actual petite people. Otherwise, I&#8217;m not small in any way, I haven&#8217;t worked out in a while. You&#8217;re the one extremely offended, and are on the verge of breathing fire, it seems.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1593" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Nothing wrong with saying that she is &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; for a model. However, there is something to be said about whether that SHOULD be plus-sized for a model. The modeling industry isn&#8217;t exactly kind to women and their body images. </p>
<p>Beyond that, where you make yourself sound like an idiot is by saying that everyone offended is  the ones that don&#8217;t want to lose the weight. On the contrary, the people who are offended probably DO want to lose weight, and this probably makes them feel self-conscious. Where you make yourself sound worse is with this: I&#8217;m 5&#8217;1&#8221; and petite models are STILL bigger than me. Interesting. If you earned that and you&#8217;re happy with it, then good for you. If you are that thin naturally, then you don&#8217;t really have the right to talk to women about losing weight because you&#8217;ve never even had to try. Again, if you earned it, good for you. If not, don&#8217;t overstep.<br />
This is coming from someone that never had to work to lose weight because I was always size 0. I felt great about myself BECAUSE my body proportions were what society considered ideal. By society, I mean the media&#8217;s projection of society. I never gave anyone a hard time about their weight or acted like I was superior just because I was blessed with an &#8220;ideal&#8221; look. The problem here is that I, and many other women, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, built up my/their entire &#8220;ideal self&#8221; and &#8220;worthy-looking self&#8221; based on what I looked like then, what those women in magazines look like, the actresses on TV and in movies, etc. The media continues to create an ideal body image for women that isn&#8217;t always manageable. </p>
<p>I have had two kids now. My body has changed. I am a size 6/8. You know what? I can&#8217;t stand it. I get disgusted with myself when I look in the mirror. You know what else, I WANT to look better. I workout everyday, despite the fact that I have an entire household to run. I eat right. I&#8217;ve even tried crash diets. I&#8217;ve even tried NOT eating. The fact is that even though my weight has gradually (way more gradually than I would like) gone down, my proportions just aren&#8217;t what they were before. I have hips. I have boobs. I find it insulting, and frankly, ignorant that someone would say that if I&#8217;m not okay with the word &#8220;plus-sized&#8221; in this context, then obviously I just don&#8217;t want to lose weight.<br />
Saying that if girls are offended, then maybe they should lose weight is exactly the problem here. Girls who have a healthy weight and a healthy BMI (and by healthy, I mean for their height, age, sex, etc.) still feel the need to keep on losing/trying to lose, and end up trying to do so in unhealthy ways. This  is due to their own insecurities, yes, but where do you think that insecurity comes from? A lot of places, but one of them is most assuredly the media and the modeling industry.</p>

I&#8217;m 5&#8217;2 and thin as well but that doesn&#8217;t mean I should be what people aspire to be. The point is that we, as society, need to be changing what the &#8220;norm&#8221; is. We shouldn&#8217;t be allowing magazines and the media to define what is normal and what is &#8220;plus-sized&#8221;. Maybe you and I should gain some weight? Think before you say something so ignorant because people will 100% turn it right around on you and tell you to eat a burger or wear some higher heels so you don&#8217;t look like such a midget.<br />
Not to mention, you&#8217;re tiny due to genetics. There are MANY factors that go into someone&#8217;s weight, from genetics to diseases to stress and so much more. You can&#8217;t just generalize everyone and tell them to lose some weight.</p>
