                        <p>About Me</p>
                        Claire Casey has spent years traveling the sometimes dazzling, sometimes dark and rocky paths that connect the hearts of men to the women they love. As a lifelong writer, she has studied and written about the ways men and women grow (or destroy) love. Unlike the spotlight-loving, entertainment-based celebrity relationship coaches, Claire isn't a model or a TV spokesperson, and she doesn't have a lot of academic letters after her name... She just quietly empowers women to attract the kind of man who will treasure and protect a woman's heart like the rare and beautiful gem it is.

<blockquote>
<h4>This may come as a shock to you but guys have different eyeballs than you do.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>You know why I&#8217;m saying that?</p>
<p>Because when YOU look at yourself in the mirror, you see that front tooth that&#8217;s a bit crooked, the line where your bra presses in (you call this your &#8216;back fat&#8217;), the too-small breasts or the too-wide rear, your goofy knees, funny toes&#8230;. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>But you know what your MAN sees?</p>
<p>A woman he&#8217;d love to strip naked and get busy with right this instant, maybe sooner.</p>
<h2>MY PERSONAL BODY PART CONFESSION..</h2>
<p>Maybe you have a muffin top &#8216;thing,&#8217; but I used to HATE my feet.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I had surgery on my big toes (bunions, it&#8217;s such an ugly word!!) and for the next 20 years I zealously covered my feet. I never EVER owned a pair of sandals or open-toed shoes and would have died before I let a man openly look at my feet.</p>
<p>I have a big scar running the length of both big toes. My second toe is longer. My feet are&#8230; wanky. You know. Ugh, I could make myself MISERABLE thinking about my feet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shockingly, amazingly, wonderfully, I found a man actually willing (he would say, desperate!) to marry me.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re laughing now, but at the time, I found it next to impossible to think about what kind of man would marry me &#8216;even with these feet.&#8217;</p>
<h2>3 WAYS MEN SEE YOUR BODY</h2>
<p>If you asked my man which of my physical attributes attracted him, it&#8217;s really hard for him to move past the standard T&amp;A answer you&#8217;d probably get from any man. You can almost see a physical effort as he drags his sex-craving brain past the chest, past the butt, and FINALLY he&#8217;ll tell you something like,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;She has gorgeous shoulders&#8230;&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet he didn&#8217;t even know I had scars on my feet for the first 10 years we were married.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: Men see your body in three ways, and it&#8217;s nothing like the way you see yourself.</p>
<h4>#1 They see what makes you WOMANLY</h4>
<p>This means when they look at you they instantly notice the things about your body that make you uniquely a woman. Breasts, hips, ass, curves&#8230; Even the way you walk. It&#8217;s nearly impossible for a red-blooded heterosexual male to notice anything before they read the parts of your body that say: I am a woman.</p>
<p>Your arm flaps do not make this list.</p>
<p>Your cellulite does not make this list.</p>
<p>Your stretch marks do not make this list.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<h4>#2 They see what makes you UNIQUE</h4>
<p>That chipped tooth you hate? They think it&#8217;s kind of charming.</p>
<p>The muffin top? They can&#8217;t see it because it&#8217;s too near your ass, which they think is the finest thing in nine counties.</p>
<p>Do you think your lips are too thin? They just love it when you smile at them. (And truthfully, when they think about your lips on their body, they are NOT thinking &#8216;Oh her lips are too thin.&#8217; I PROMISE.)</p>
<p>If guys notice a particular body part of yours that you think makes you hideous (and I guarantee you they would never use that term) they just think it makes you uniquely&#8230; you! And since it&#8217;s YOU they are desperate for, they want that part of you as much as the others.</p>
<h4>#3 They see what you constantly draw their attention to</h4>
<p>This is where you have the power to rock or ruin a relationship.</p>
<p>When you constantly complain about your own body, a man&#8217;s desire to enjoy and love you are being eroded a little at a time. In other words, you&#8217;re rejecting him.</p>
<blockquote><p>He thinks, &#8216;I could touch her body all day,&#8217; and you say, &#8216;I&#8217;m too flabby.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;re not only tearing yourself down, you&#8217;re tearing HIM &#8211; his thoughts, his desires for you, his excitement about you &#8211; down.</p>
<p>And it works the other way, too. Show off your pedicure (I do, now!), go sleeveless, wear that backless dress, and ruthlessly tease him with the body he absolutely adores.</p>
<h2>A MAN LOVES A REAL WOMAN</h2>
<p>Of course he looks at the naked, &#8216;perfect&#8217; girls in the magazine or online. And of course you&#8217;re bombarded with &#8216;perfect&#8217; skinny chicks on the runway or the billboard.</p>
<p>But a picture of perfection &#8211; whether it&#8217;s real or not &#8211; is no competition whatsoever for a living, breathing, fragrant woman sitting next to a man at a restaurant. Or pressed slightly against him in the elevator. Perfection can go hang; you are up close and personal.</p>
<p>Stepford wives are creepy. You can be assured that while he might fantasize about a playmate of the month, he&#8217;ll take a real woman over a figment of his imagination EVERY time.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Celebrate your body (and let him do it, too)!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course you want to invest time and energy into a healthy, beautiful body. But meanwhile, don&#8217;t let your own issues with your body drive him away. You deserve all the fabulous man-attention as he wants to give you!</p>

It&#8217;s disturbing because it&#8217;s apparent women trust the opinions and ideas of women about men more than they do  men about men. Everything in this article has been said by countless men, countless comedians, countless sitcoms, etc&#8230;. Men aren&#8217;t that hard to figure out, we like things simple and comfortable so our taste are simple. Sure, there are some more than likely homosexual guys or an angry undesirable dude that somehow built up in his mind that a woman has to be &#8220;perfect &#8221; for him to get with her, that don&#8217;t agree with this list, but generally it&#8217;s mostly spot on. Just be clean and do your best, and remember one major thing&#8230;.. What you think about your body is completely irrelevant. Focus on being an awesome woman and not an annoyance, and you are good to go.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3685" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There is truth to this article. Perhaps it&#8217;s critical to underscore that when a man loves a woman, truly loves a woman, her flaws will give so called hot women a run for their money.  I will say this, intimacy with a flawed women for which I love deeply is far better than that of intimacy with a woman who is hot and I zero feelings for.  Different strokes for different folks.  Give a man love, respect and treat him as a man, and he will love every single flaw on your body.  Most &#8220;so called&#8221; hot women are so clueless when it comes to loving a man that the so called perfect gets old real quick.  I&#8217;ll take imperfection hands down! Besides looks don&#8217;t last for ever and cannot be sustained indefinitely.  </p>

I started to read the other comments before I posted my note (reminder to never do that again) and I have to disagree with the negative comments wholeheartedly. Some people should just keep their thoughts to themselves. Thank you for an uplifting, encouraging message. It made me reflect on every time I complain about my thighs and tummy just to be reminded of the way my husband bites his lip when he talks about my thighs. And my tummy&#8230;well, I&#8217;m the mommy of five children&#8230;no shame in that!</p>

Of course there are some dumped out trolls just like there are among dudes, but if you cant just appreciate the beauty of a woman then you&#8217;re flat out lost. Their hips which we are instinctively attracted to relating to fertility and child birthing abilities. Stretch marks mean either she was small and got a bit bigger or big and got smaller. 90% of the time its from child birth, the most beautiful thing a woman can do (IMO). If a stretch mark can throw you off your game when youre in bed with a lady, then I think that you should get your balls checked because what makes men MEN doesn&#8217;t seem to be present in that sad sack between YOUR legs.</p>

I mean, your body must be absolutely perfect right to go around judging other peoples, especially women who have stretch marks from a little thing called pregnancy. My mum showed me the stretch marks she has from giving birth to me, it made me overwhelmingly happy that she went through that for me-just like it should make any man love a woman who does that to give birth to his child. Women are already bombarded with images of stick thin models who make women with lower confidence feel like shit without having to come onto articles like this one and see a man (who frankly, from your pic is nothing special) being judgemental. Get over yourself</p>

She is so beautiful to me. But she saw herself differently I guess. She said that she has never liked her own breasts. How sad is that? We&#8217;ve been together almost fifteen years now and married for nine of those fifteen. I met her when I was thirty six and she was forty. I don&#8217;t think much has changed between us. I still look at her in awe. I feel like a teenager when I&#8217;m with her&#8230;and we&#8217;re always together&#8230;why wouldn&#8217;t we be? She has been the most amazing step-mother to my two kids&#8230;one of whom is attending college now at San Diego State University and the other one in her senior year in high school. My kids adore her. What a blessing to have this amazing, wonderful, talented, caring, loving, compassionate and giving lady in my life. Her family is also really wonderful too.</p>
<p>Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. I have always been attracted to personality and character over looks. I am so blessed to have my wife and best friend with me&#8230;my soul mate. I have my flaws&#8230;external and internal&#8230;but she still loves me and I love her. Even after a disagreement, we still hug and kiss and tell each other that we love each other. That is the only way to move forward. Love yourself just as you are&#8230;because you are stuck with the body you got.</p>

It&#8217;s another one of those &#8220;you&#8217;re beautiful no matter what you are&#8221; articles that are written to make others feel better about themselves no matter the circumstance. EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL! Love you for YOU! Bullshit.</p>
<p>Ladies, be honest&#8230;would you date this man:</p>
<p><a href="http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/</a>&#8230;/overweight-middle-aged&#8230;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even f*cking lie. </p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re at a point where women expect far more from men physically than men expect from women. Guys are so used to be labeled as &#8220;pigs&#8221; and &#8220;shallow&#8221; that we aren&#8217;t allowed to have an opinion anymore. And if we do&#8230;we&#8217;re assholes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you have a muffin top ‘thing&#8230;&#8221;. Yeah that&#8217;s a real thing. It&#8217;s called being overweight. I&#8217;m overweight as well&#8230;I guess my gut hanging over my belt is just part of my &#8220;character&#8221; and is a sexy thing to other women, right? Guess them women see it as my pants are too tight &#8220;thing&#8221;&#8230;shut up. I&#8217;m fat. I know it. Stop sugar coating it.</p>
<p>Apart from popular belief, guys look at more than your tits and ass. For most guys it&#8217;s more an &#8220;overall&#8221; thing. And in overall I mean looks, cleanliness, and personality&#8230;yep I know, crazy! Men actually like personality! We&#8217;re not cavemen that are all &#8220;ugh, jane pretty, have tight ass&#8230;many many good babies.&#8221; </p>
<p>Women know what is overweight. Men know what is overweight. Attractive people attract other attractive people. It&#8217;s fucking simple. If you&#8217;re average to ugly like myself&#8230; know what I&#8217;m talkin about. If you&#8217;re one of those &#8220;fine&#8221; people, I guarantee you&#8217;re laughing.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3679" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think there are a lot of thin women that pick their bodies apart.  At least I am guilty of that.  I try not to pick out things I don&#8217;t like, but we all have them.  I ask if my thighs look fat in certain pants and my husband gets frustrated and says he doesn&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about&#8230;he loves my body and says I&#8217;m hot.  I suspect I&#8217;m not the only one.  I don&#8217;t weigh myself but I&#8217;m guessing I weigh about 115 and am 5&#8217;2&#8243;.  So many women have low self esteem at least when it comes to their  bodies.  Whether we are thin, average, or overweight. ..a little positivity in an article like this can go a long way.  </p>

I was married for almost 10 years to my soul mate cancer hit her 3 years into our marriage. First and foremost she is my best friend and I love her with every beat of my heart. On that note we feel apart we are divorced but I will wait I will jump and I will do anything to hold that beautiful creature God gave me in my arms. I posted your story to her, it was a major part of our fallout out after cancer, she stopped believing she was beautiful. The truth is Shes the most georgious woman I&#8217;ve ever known. I will wait to see if she sees what I do about her. ps Shawna I will ALWAYS LOVE YOU!  Thank you so much for this story!<br />

That&#8217;s the hardest to deal with, especially when she isn&#8217;t willing to do anything about it. Sadly, that could break a relationship.</p>

Love, sex, sexiness — comes from the soul. It runs way deeper than any stretch mark, any bad hair day (and as a shaved head man, I haven&#8217;t had a bad hair day myself in roughly 20 years), and/or whether or not that dress makes your butt look big &#8230; we just like looking at your butt <img src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

A) unless I have a perfect body, the idea of being with someone who does is too intimidating and puts a ton of pressure on me to try to get on her &#8220;level&#8221;<br />
B) have you watched porno lately?  The majority of women in the films and videos we watch have curves, hips, tits and ass as well as body modifications. I assume you are using the term &#8220;porno&#8221; to refer to a bygone ideal of what adult actresses look like, but this is the 21st century, anyone can be a star in porn, body type doesn&#8217;t matter, attitude and skills (and a market for it) does.<br />
Men like what men like, it&#8217;s pretty subjective. The purpose of the article was to show women that what they hate about their bodies may very well be what their men love.  And even if it isn&#8217;t, women shouldn&#8217;t use their own insecurities to push their partner away from that part because that drives a distance between them that can grow into resentment, frustration and possibly them leaving or being unfaithful because they feel helpless and confused and rejected. </p>

Mature, interesting and dare I say &#8211;real&#8211; men recognize beauty in the flaws and love every bit of it. Just like us women do with men. Not all men look like movie stars or models, but they are beautiful in their own way. Yes, men can be beautiful even if they don&#8217;t have six packs or muscular arms. Appreciate the flaws in others, and your flaws will be appreciated in return. Once you stop thinking others are looking only for perfection, and most importantly when you stop looking for perfection in others, a whole world of magnificent and diverse beauty will unfold for you.</p>

What drives me wild may be rooted in physical chemistry, but it transcends basic physical traits. For example, kindness and sincerity make me sexually alert. Foreplay for me often starts when my partner has spontaneously said or done something genuine, and selfless.  I just want to strip her down right there, and give her tenfold the pleasure and adoration she just bestowed on a nameless stranger. Love is the greatest aphrodisiac!</p>

As a guy, a pretty good looking one too, I see all the physical things, like the author mentioned; typical T&amp;A. But you know what? The only thing that keeps me around? The woman herself. The Author is right when she says that men will celebrate that thing you hate about your body because to us, when we get to know you and be a part of your life, it means it&#8217;s just for us; we saw the diamond in the rough and got lucky enough to enjoy it. Care less about your body (but stay healthy) and care more about developing yourself.</p>

I mean sure she said men like real women, but if you bothered to actually read what she wrote instead of stopping at that one single moment you would know that she wasn&#8217;t talking about skinny women vs. fat women, but rather a REAL woman (as in every woman) vs. an overly madeup picture in a magazine. Like what the fuck else do you want her to say. Seriously read before you speak because no where in the entire article is she shaming skinny women.</p>

And the whole point was lost to me when she included the dumb section titled: A MEN LOVES A REAL WOMAN. Where she goes on and on at how all these &#8220;perfect&#8221; skinny women who apparently BOMBARD you while they&#8217;re on the runway. Yes, I&#8217;ve read this article, if you can call it that. But the moment I read that she makes slender women look less appealing because they are not &#8220;REAL&#8221;, I cannot agree with that. EVERY WOMAN IS REAL.<br />
I agree that when a man sees a woman&#8217;s body, he sees it through a different perspective. But that&#8217;s kind of obvious, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
What I don&#8217;t agree with is making slender women look &#8220;fake&#8221; or &#8220;perfect&#8221;. No one is perfect, not even those &#8220;REAL&#8221; woman she wrote about.<br />
So take it or leave it, I honestly don&#8217;t give a flying fuck. It&#8217;s my opinion.  </p>

Its very pervasive in our society now&#8230; that to be a real woman, one must not look too &#8220;perfect.&#8221;<br />
Its probably based on jealousy issues of women who want a perfect body but don&#8217;t want to do the work to get it, but no matter what its based on, the feeling is still there.<br />
I&#8217;m in the same generation as 007femaleagent, I&#8217;m 28 this month &amp; this is a real problem&#8230;  If you don&#8217;t think we have a genuine concern, maybe you should read my article on &#8220;Does Society Expect Women to Apologize for Being Fit and Healthy?&#8221;<br />
There is a lot of women who feel this way, our bodies are somehow not real because they look so damn good to men when we&#8217;re wearing a bikini (or just plain naked), but then a woman who&#8217;s overweight wears a fatkini and she&#8217;s praised by other women for being bold and empowered (because she&#8217;s fat?).</p>

<p>My whole point is, which many of you seem to missing, is that all women are real. The ones on TV, Internet, billboards, runway, kitchen, walking down the street, giving birth, running a marathon or whatever&#8230; they&#8217;re all real. </p>

Its unrealistic, this is not how a normal person eats.  Anorexia and manorexia is massive in the catwalk world.  (including celebrity, tv (the people on the bilboards).. Its a life forced on people trying to break through into that world.  This is very different from a normal person just being normal and healthy.  All those starved, emaciated women&#8230; are just that.. starved and emaciated.</p>

We have a high metabolism. No matter how much junk food I eat, I can&#8217;t gain weight. Which often caused bullying while I was at school. The girls would spread rumors that I&#8217;m anorexic, bulimic and what not. When in reality I could eat more than them.<br />
I agree that many models have eating disorders, but not all slender women are anorexic or starve themselves.<br />
I never fat shame or pass judgment.  I wish other people would do the same. </p>

I don&#8217;t personally like seeing every inch of her hip bones, thigh gap, ribs, clavicle, etc.  I also don&#8217;t like the makeup that looks like it was applied by Dutch Boy.  I&#8217;m sure plenty of men do though, and I don&#8217;t see a problem with that.  To each their own, and she has every right to make herself look that way if she wants.  Point is that if you are going to go off on everybody that takes part in shaming skinny women, you might need to look are your own message where you are doing the same against bigger women that men will prefer or not over the skinny women depending on their personal taste.</p>

The average lady is larger than a size 0&#8230; so whilst the size 0 is thrown at society by every means of advertising&#8230;&#8230; the article is saying that most men actually don&#8217;t like eating chicken bones.. and prefer abit of rump steak.

Where did you &#8220;walk catwalk&#8221; (who the hell says it like that anyway?) and for how long? How many agencies were you with and what year was this?<br />
There are a lot of negative things about the industry, and one of those is forcing women into a mold they don&#8217;t fit. That doesn&#8217;t, however, mean that there aren&#8217;t women who naturally fit the mold and are beautiful. It&#8217;s also something to be said that modeling is broadening a lot and while I split my time between commercial and editorial modeling at size 2, I have friends making a great living at size 6-8 and am acquainted with some very successful 10-14s.<br />
This article is speaking against the EXACT disgusting, hateful comments you are making right now. There is nothing wrong with being skinny, or having boobs that aren&#8217;t big enough (this article says that, if you read it), and chances are the guy you&#8217;re with is attracted to you and doesn&#8217;t have a problem with any of it.<br />
I will say, what you see on TV and billboards is not reality. Sure, that girl may wake up thin and aesthetically pleasing, but when I see myself in ads or on a billboard&#8211; yes, sometimes made more thin&#8211; that&#8217;s not me.<br />
Because it&#8217;s an EFFING PICTURE. And I am a real, breathing, thinking woman. This article isn&#8217;t insulting the girls on the runway or even the girls in porn; it&#8217;s saying that they are images and not real and there, but the girl they are with, the girl they CHOSE, is sitting next to them in all of her real, breathing, thinking glory.</p>

To celebrate your own beauty and not to focus on those flawed parts. I&#8217;m a thin, attractive, lively, extremely intellectual woman and I have my doubts about my own body. I did not, in any way shape or form get offended by this article. Seems like instead of Jessica needing an eye exam, you might want to take a lesson in humility. Be humble. And learn how to objectively read an article, instead of feeling this is a personal attack on your body type.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3200" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>why do all these articles start off any conversation with some variation of &#8220;well, of course men are going to say breasts and butts&#8230; those sex-addled cave creatures that they are&#8230;.. but if you corner them and force them to use that lump of goo they call a brain&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;. i mean&#8230;. really?</p>
<p>saying things like: &#8220;it’s really hard for him to move past the standard T&amp;A answer you’d probably get from any man. You can almost see a physical effort as he drags his sex-craving brain past the chest, past the butt, and FINALLY he’ll tell you something like&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Isn&#8217;t funny.<br />
It&#8217;s sexist, and perpetuates a notion that men lack agency in matters of sex, that they are controlled by some genetic short-circuit that prevents them from thinking or acting like rational beings when women are present to oogle at. it coddles the same perceptions that allow people to blame victims of sexual violence&#8230;. &#8220;Men can&#8217;t help themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Straight dope: as far as VISUAL attraction goes, guys see silhouette, then facial features (including expression/disposition), and  then, LASTLY, the &#8220;details&#8221; (be they &#8220;heh.. boobies&#8221;, or your chipped tooth, they&#8217;re never higher than 3rd on the list of physical features of visual attraction)</p>
<p>ADVERTISERS care about breast size, crows feet, &#8220;back fat&#8221;&#8230;..<br />
Advertisers tell you that details matter, because there are a LOT of details. details are something to fixate on and tear your self esteem down to the point that you need validation, and crave &#8220;solutions&#8221; to your &#8220;problem areas&#8221;.<br />
&#8230;.and create a market for products that could fix those problems.</p>
<p>if you&#8217;ve got a relatively proportional silhouette (notice I don&#8217;t say &#8220;skinny&#8221; or &#8221; curvy&#8221; or any other more detail-oriented terminology), and an attractive face (friendly/cheerful/sly EXPRESSIONS are often far more important than physical features, (facial features, good or bad, generally just become, like that &#8220;chipped tooth&#8221;, endearing qualities))&#8230;. I would argue that nothing much else matters.</p>
<p>plenty of generally thought of as &#8220;ugly&#8221; folks have no problem at all finding love, sexual fulfillment, and happiness with partners&#8230;.. because, deep down, physical features don&#8217;t really matter all that much. An inviting expression  and a genetically &#8220;normal&#8221; silhouette, will win out over some asinine, nitpicky physical quality, every-single-time.</p>

I cover myself up because I know that no one wants to see this mess and I&#8217;m a size 8.. maybe 10 on some jeans..  If I knew I was pregnant with my first kid, I would have went to the gym and took care of myself so I didn&#8217;t get fat.. Unfortunately I found out too late.. My second baby I knew about so I only gained 5 lbs in the last 2 weeks.. sad part is my body was already seriously wrecked by the first one.. All the fat I couldn&#8217;t lose and the stretchmarks are disgusting. .</p>

This article is not about giving anyone a pass to let themselves go, but instead not heavily scrutinize themselves. It&#8217;s like when you&#8217;re a teenager and you have a pimple and you wake up and you notice it&#8217;s there and you&#8217;re so conscious of it the whole day that you&#8217;re just SURE that everyone&#8217;s looking at you, looking at it, and yet a good amount of people you interact with will only notice it because you point it out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for people to learn to love and be happy with the body they have. That doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be satisfied with everything. You can make changes if you&#8217;re not satisfied with your body, but none of those changes are coming in the blink of an eye, or overnight, so why be miserable until those results come. It&#8217;s often that misery that derails progress toward those results.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3144" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;m not sure I agree with this article. I will say this, if a man meets a woman and falls for her as she is at that moment flaws and all, then he is obviously attracted to the whole woman and is able to see past whatever flaws there might be. This does not let men or women off the hook over the course of a long relationship. You still need to take of yourself, keep the extra weight off, live healthy, look nice, keep clean, dress up every now and then, dress sexy every now and then. Just because your man (or woman) fell for you five or tens years ago when you looked a certain way does not give you permission to let yourself go. Just because you were a little chubby when you met does not mean you can add more weight to that chub. That back fat is not attractive. That ear hair is not ok to let go. Looks and physical attraction are very important aspects of any relationship. Intimacy is a necessity of a long lasting relationship and intimacy hinges largely (though not entirely) on physical attraction. The point is your partner can still love you but no longer be attracted to you. It is up to you as a good partner to take of yourself and continue to present an attractive appearance based on whatever your partner finds attractive.</p>

This was put much more kindly and with more precision than I could muster at the time of writing my point. This article makes it seem like that &#8220;love at for sight&#8221; fairy tale story is going to go on forever without any upkeep. Yes, you still need to take care of yourself, try to look your best, do more and keep improving on yourself. You just don&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; a man or woman&#8217;s affection like a prize and keep it for life without effort. That&#8217;s not just an opinion, it&#8217;s a fact that in time you grow and change. Each person needs to grow through a process of self betterment for the other. Otherwise old age, time, along with others who are single and improving themselves, will pull down your attention factor.</p>

I agreed, to an extent. I got a little heat because I stated that if I honestly loved someone, then yes, their weight would bother me. I didn&#8217;t mean a couple of pounds, or a slightly saggy frame. What I meant is that I couldn&#8217;t sit back and watch someone I love hurt themselves. A lot of people seem to think in extremes: either they hate themselves and can&#8217;t fathom anyone finding them attractive until they change (whatever) or they insist that no one should have a problem with how they look. I think that you shouldn&#8217;t obsess over how you look, but at the same time strive to remain attractive to yourself and to the person you&#8217;ve decided to be with.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3646" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have to both agree and disagree. I have gained 30 lbs since I met my husband, 13 years ago. I went from a size 4 to a size 10 (with my frame, it&#8217;s generally 1 size for every 10 lbs, so 6,8,10). But my husband is much more grabby and excited to get physical NOW than he was when we first got married. Honestly, most of it is T&amp;A, as I went from a B cup to a DDD cup, so maybe that&#8217;s why. But the point is, yes, physical attraction is important. But I think it&#8217;s more important to dress in appropriately fitting clothes and have good grooming (i.e., shaving, styling hair, makeup, etc) than to keep a constant weight. I don&#8217;t do the whole yoga pants all day thing, or not wash my hair for 3 days or something. I style my hair every day (even if it is just in a sleek ponytail), where a touch of makeup, jewelry, and clothes that fit my body. I tell him I try to make myself look good just for HIM. I think he appreciates the effort I put into it, even if I&#8217;m not skin and bones anymore.</p>

She&#8217;s beautiful in my eyes, flaws and all and I just want her to see herself with the same adoring eyes that I see her with every time I look at her</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3547" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>THANK YOU Bermon for explaining the real point of the article from a male perspective. So many here are so full of themselves and their own sensitive feelings, that they totally missed it. It&#8217;s about having confidence in yourself, and understanding that those that truly love us don&#8217;t care as much as we sometimes think they do&#8230;It goes without saying that it doesn&#8217;t mean that anyone should ignore taking care of themselves &#8220;reasonably&#8221;, BUT it&#8217;s also a reminder that what SOCIETY often portrays as acceptable and normal is not something we need to allow to kill our joy, and the level of intimacy we have with our significant others. This article is only for people who are not caught up in their own ideals of beauty and perfection, but only of the love they have of self, and the love another has for them..Anyone who dares to imply that &#8220;perfect&#8221; is anything else totally missed the boat on this one&#8230;and people who are skinny have the same issues sometimes when it comes to flaws that may not be noticed by others. The &#8220;skinny runway&#8221; example was only used to symbolize the ideals of society, NOT to imply they are not also REAL&#8230;..PLUS she talked about a lot more than simply body size. Everything is not for everybody, so perhaps if women totally missed the point, this article was not FOR them!!</p>

Like the cheating man who wants all his girlfriend/wife&#8217;s facebook passwords. I&#8217;ll have you know, I have been in love with a girl named Dakotah Schmidt for over ten years. We were best friends. Then she started seeing this guy named AJ. They did alot of meth. She stopped and never became one of those posters. </p>
<p>Now, she is married to a rich man for his money, she told me. I still love her. I don&#8217;t look at women as more than friends. I&#8217;m not gay. Just remember, some of us truly fall in love, and are not dogs and pigs like the rest of you. </p>
<p>Do you know what it is like being the last decent person in a land of monsters? If you have sex with someone, and do not love them, you are trash, both genders. It&#8217;s not nice to say this feminist garbage. You assume all men and women are the whores society has created. Go burn your bras, leave love to real humans. A man and woman are supposed to fall in love. The way you and men like you see the world is not the right way.</p>
<p>You deviants are ruining the world with garbage like this article. You make it seem okay to be a lesser man, as </p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche might say in passing. He was wrong, there are no supermen, there are humans, and whatever amoral monsters that this disgusting wasteland of morality has brought upon us.</p>
<p>Real men fall in love with women, not her ass.</p>

But, Brad Kirk, even though you do make a point, I also have to disagree slightly. You made a comment about how there are only humans and the whores society has turned people into but, is it not human nature to be naturally and biologically attracted to the sexual organs, if you will,  of the opposite sex and same sex in more often than not occasions? I feel as if this article was just ment to empower females to feel less  self conscious about insignificant things about themselves, not accept and expect men to be okay with poor hygiene and life choices simply because of sex and a nice rack. Although I see your point about the humn race and I agree, but I believe the level of understanding may have been biased and tilted in your comment.. It&#8217;s truly not fare to be angry with her article when this was obviously written toward female audiences but its not like she put men down, she was actually praising the male hormones of attraction. Either way, I hope I don&#8217;t offend but science will prove and has proved that men and woman look at particular parts of the body upon meeting a potential partner..  I&#8217;m sorry but I don&#8217;t believe this should be labled as feminist just because she points that out in a way to help her article.. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3091" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Not every man is a love stuck idiot. Fat, sweaty, smelly, unkept, flabby women are noticed just as much as hot, sexy, great smelling, skinny, perfect feet women. We just aren&#8217;t attracted to them for their looks or relations with then. It&#8217;s to point out as a out of place anomaly. Like 1 peanut in a bowl of M&amp;Ms. The woman who wrote this is just as mindlessly blinded by love as the man she&#8217;s talking about doing this action. That&#8217;s NOT the action of EVERY man.  </p>
<p>{&#8220;If you asked my man which of my physical attributes attracted him, it’s really hard for him to move past the standard T&amp;A answer you’d probably get from any man. You can almost see a physical effort as he drags his sex-craving brain past the chest, past the butt, and FINALLY he’ll tell you something like,</p>
<p>‘She has gorgeous shoulders…’</p>
<p>I bet he didn’t even know I had scars on my feet for the first 10 years we were married.&#8221;}</p>
<p>The last sentence is a woman who is oblivious to the fact that she is a mindless, faceless, sex partner and trying desperately to grasp for anything to ignore that fact. If she wasn&#8217;t an idiot, she&#8217;d notice that if he hasn&#8217;t noticed scars on her feet for 10 years, ANYONE reasonable would suggest he isn&#8217;t paying close attention to you. If he only sees chest, ass, butt, then he&#8217;s seeing you as a faceless sex toy, NOT something special!</p>
<p>&#8220;#1 They see what makes you WOMANLY&#8221;<br />
But that doesn&#8217;t make them blind to the equally seen flaws. Trying to convince yourself of this authors error makes you as blind to the truth as her. As a human animal, we are chemically conditioned to look for a mating partner. As a secondary condition of this, we are to look for the genetically superior and unflawed. </p>
<p>&#8220;#2 They see what makes you UNIQUE&#8221;<br />
Yes, they see it but that doesn&#8217;t mean they automatically care for it! A turd rolled in sprinkles is still a turd, but gets more attention because it&#8217;s a freakish thing, not a well accepted and wanted thing. </p>
<p>&#8220;#3 They see what you constantly draw their attention to&#8221;<br />
BUT they aren&#8217;t suddenly blind men to the things you don&#8217;t draw attention too! If you paint your face blue, but wear no clothes, then say, &#8220;See! Look at my face!&#8221; The man isn&#8217;t going to ignore the fact that your naked.</p>
<p>This entire article is reality from someone who believes in the concept of &#8220;Ignorance is bliss&#8221; but forgets that just because you stick your head in the sand, it doesn&#8217;t disappear and go away.</p>

You try to rip all the females on here a new one by trying to belittle us and make us out to be stupid or ignorant, basically provoking a female predominant website. I&#8217;m,  sorry but I am sure you are smart enough to know that you are bullying us. We are smart enough to know that men will notice if we aren&#8217;t taking care of our bodies, if we have bad b.o., edc. When the auther is talking about how men dont notice flaws, I promise you, we aren&#8217;t stupid enough to think that men dont. This article was written to impower women about their bodies and partner relationships with some small obvious exaggeration, I doubt that makes her a mindless sex toy.  So get off your high horse with nit picking, over thought comments and unnecessary aggression . Fucking troll.</p>

It was about men looking past the little insecurities that every woman has and not expecting them to be as perfect as the magazines(because that&#8217;s not reality). There also are things that men find sexy on women that we don&#8217;t even realize. And those are the things they focus on when we are too busy focusing on flaws. Its also about learning to appreciate and enjoy your mans admiration instead of always feeling like you don&#8217;t deserve it and making him feel unwanted. </p>

I love it because it comes with her brain, her personality, her humor, which isn&#8217;t much, her loving nature and because she is the sexiest thing on planet earth. Of course that is my opinion, but I can look at her for hours, with her clothes off or with them on. Either way she is a very beautiful sexy woman. I love her entire body, not just certain spots. When she gets naked and lays down on the bed, face down, I look at her across the room and the way her back curves up to her butt, whew, drives me crazy. I love to give her head to toe massages. I even suck her toes while massaging her feet because she has sexy toes. There is not a spot on my beautiful, sexy wife&#8217;s body that I don&#8217;t like, or that turns me off. I could look and just touch and rub her for days. I don&#8217;t understand why women feel that there is something wrong with their bodies. Every woman does. Us men, we don&#8217;t see you, the way you see you. I keep telling my wife, I wish you could see you, the way I see you. But if she could, she wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep her hands off of herself, because when I&#8217;m around her I find it very difficult to keep my hand off her. She calls me annoying, but I call me crazy in love with her, and her body.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3045" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree with your ultimate point, but not the anger associated with your overall statement.</p>
<p>The article isn&#8217;t necessarily targeting the holistic woman&#8217;s self-worth/self-valuation issue that you seem to think it should (and as such, I highly recommend that you write an article on this yourself), but a critical issue in male-female relationships, in which women become increasingly self-destructive in their self-view and self-worth and thus require constant &#8220;petting&#8221; by their male (or, really, female) counterpart (which they in turn refuse to believe).</p>
<p>What you need to understand here Althea is that there are a lot of women who unintentionally (or maybe it is intentional) sabotage their relationships through their overwhelmingly self-critical estimation of themselves, their constant self-directed negative evaluations in the face of repeated positive reinforcement by the men (or women) they are with. There is nothing harder, as a man, than to compliment a woman and have her essentially call you a liar because somehow your perspective is biased, while hers is entirely objective (which is, pardon my language, utter bullshit). However, we as men (and again, I&#8217;m sure women too) get tired of constantly fighting undeserved (at least from our point) negative self-image, or, more essentially, being called liars because we think the woman we are with is beautiful.</p>
<p>That said, you may also want to learn something about biological anthropology &#8211; try as we might, men are visual creatures who notice reproductive potential first and foremost (T&amp;A) and go from there. It&#8217;s been hard-wired into us, and anyone who tells you differently is full of crap. I suggest you learn to deal with it &#8211; it&#8217;s a simple fact of life. That said, there are men among us who try to move beyond physical properties/characteristics to something a little deeper, but don&#8217;t crucify us for thousands of years of evolution. We don&#8217;t deserve it, anymore than we deserve to be called liars because we think your webbed-toes are cute.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3061" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This article is very much about the holistic woman&#8217;s self-worth/self-evaluation issue. That critical issue in m-f relationships in which women become self-destructive and require validation from their male partner comes from society&#8217;s sexualization of women in the media. </p>
<p>Women are bombarded with images of what it means to be sexy and judge themselves according to these images. Not only still images but also female characters in tv and film are made to be &#8220;sexy&#8221; because they are created by men and for men. Furthermore, a woman (for example: Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama) is more likely than a man to be criticized for the way she looks (her hair, makeup, style of dress, etc.) than her intelligence or her political acumen. </p>
<p>Women are gendered from a young age to pay attention to how they look and to meet a certain standard. Young girls are taught to wear a dress and behave a certain way according to that piece of clothing. Meanwhile boys are free to play and roughhouse without care of the restraint of their clothes. </p>
<p>Many of the men commenting on this thread agree with the article&#8217;s author. They are not liars for agreeing that they don&#8217;t see the same faults in a woman&#8217;s body that she herself sees. However, women call them liars because there is a disparity between what individual men say and what the media images of women which are created by men say.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3066" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I respectfully disagree about the holistic component. To me, this is one aspect of women&#8217;s self-worth, and as it is a discussion about an externalized component and not actually telling women to love themselves (though you may see this as implied) so much as saying &#8220;When a man says he loves something in you, he loves it, accept it, stop calling him a liar.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;women are bombarded with images of what it meas to be sexy&#8230;&#8221; so are men, but we tend to ignore this fact. Look at fairy tales or Disney films &#8211; feminists are often hyper-critical of the portrayal of women, but few balk at the way men are portrayed.  In fact, when I teach Feminist Literary theory, I often shift into Gender/Queer theory and have students consider that men are equally bombarded with concepts of masculinity. As for your comments on political women &#8211; as Neil Postman is wont to point out, there is no way that former president Taft would ever get elected in America in the age of TV &#8211; tell me, who was the last FAT president you SAW elected?</p>
<p>So Elby, while I understand your position, you have forgotten that men are gendered from a young age too &#8211; gendered in how to behave, how to respond to others, how to treat others, how to look &#8230; sound familiar? Oh yes, same sort of thing that women go through. Seems like once again it&#8217;s the human condition, so please don&#8217;t tell me women have it different than men. We are a species of sly judgment &#8211; men judge women, women judge other women, and vice versa (women judge men and men judge other men). I&#8217;m not saying that one sex has it better or worse than the other &#8211; individuals respond to it in different ways.</p>
<p>But coming back to my main point &#8211; the article isn&#8217;t about women loving themselves and their flaws &#8211; the article is about accepting that men will see you differently (and believe me, as a man I can say that I&#8217;m bombarded with those same images of beauty as women are, but if I can see past them, then why can&#8217;t my SO?).</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3067" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Of course men are gendered from a young age as well, but they are gendered in a way that is less confining. Boys are allowed to sit sloppily and be rowdy and loud. Girls should be more controlled in their behavior. Even sitting or standing in ways that take up more space increases testosterone and decreases cortisol levels, leading to feeling more powerful and capable. As young girls are taught to sit quietly they are effectively taught to shrink back, and sitting in ways that take up minimal space has the opposite effect of sitting large as testosterone decreases and cortisol increases. </p>
<p>In addition, slang that kids learn like &#8220;having the balls&#8221; to do something or being &#8220;a pussy&#8221; are gendered with the male term being positive and the female negative. And what about the insult &#8220;you ___ like a girl&#8221;? The blank is typically a sporty activity, and athletic capability is strength and power. The ultimate meaning of the insult is that acting like a girl is weak and something to be ashamed of. </p>
<p>If the article questions why women can&#8217;t see past their flaws because their male partners can, it in a way blames women for having a negative perception of themselves. Why do women have a negative perception of themselves? Surely they weren&#8217;t born that way&#8230;</p>

The author is telling women that their men love and accept them with those physical features that they (the women) might find flawed, that they believe make them unattractive. She&#8217;s telling women to understand that their men don&#8217;t see those physical &#8220;flaws&#8221; as flaws, because men and women see differently. And she is correct! Nowhere does she suggest that women should find validation for their bodies from men because women&#8217;s eyes or perspective isn&#8217;t good enough.</p>

It is quite accurate and by no means suggests that you have to have these extravagant assets in order to have a man go &#8216;googoo&#8217; for you. Men are attracted to whats naturally you or what should have been naturally you, Sometimes men have no way of knowing whats real and what isnt real on a woman just by looks alone.</p>

I dated a girl with dimples on her lower back; to me they were the sexiest things I had ever seen, to her they were embarrassing. If a guy you&#8217;re intimate with says he likes something, he likes it. The way you pinch your nose when you smile, the way snort you have when you laugh, the birth mark on your hip; its the little things that really drive guys crazy (after t&amp;a of course). Its insulting to call us liars or pretend we&#8217;re just being nice about the things we honestly find beautiful&#8230;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-3021" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As a man &#8211; I agree completely. Yes, we are hardwired for reproductive assessment (T&amp;A), and we are bombarded with idealized notions of beauty, but once we find someone we want to be with, their body flaws don&#8217;t matter (unless they have tentacles coming out of places that tentacles don&#8217;t normally come out of &#8230; of course, that kinda turns me on so&#8230;) to us nearly as much to the women.</p>
<p>But more importantly, MEN ARE THE EXACT SAME WAY.  We see ourselves as flawed (thanks to the same notions of male beauty that we are bombarded with).  We are now taught to be hairless monkeys, but not too long ago a hairy chest and thick bushy moustache (Burt Reynolds and Tom Selleck come to mind) were the epitome of masculinity. We are conflicted by who we are and who we think women want us to be (keep in mind, it is what we think women want, not necessarily what they want).</p>
<p>Ultimately (and yes, this sounds trite), we&#8217;re human, and we share the same intrinsic psychology. So just as much as you like being reassured that you&#8217;re beautiful, so does your man. Men can be just as much a bundle of insecure as women can be.</p>

I often think that guys respond well to sincere compliments directed not only toward their physical appearance (and yes we are happily looking at guys&#8217; bodies and thinkin about sex!), but *particularly* toward tasks they&#8217;ve accomplished and skills they&#8217;ve built&#8230; Or at least it seems that way to me.</p>

Your significant other will most likely love you for who you are, but physical flaws don&#8217;t only play a role in attraction or your own seen self-image. It plays a role in your general health. I&#8217;m of course talking about the heavy people who admit or claim they&#8217;re okay with being very large and overweight. I don&#8217;t mean for this to be a fat-shaming post, all I mean for it to be is an alert. You can be comfortable with how you look and concerned for your health at the same time. The appearance of something doesn&#8217;t always go right in hand with how beneficial it is to you, so just because you&#8217;re &#8220;okay&#8221; with it, doesn&#8217;t make it a healthy thing or choice.</p>

Cancer, Diabetes, High blood pressure, Low blood pressure, High Cholesterol, Elevated Triglycerides, and so on are not a &#8216;FAT&#8217; persons disease. They do not discriminate. You can be thin, sit your ass on the sofa all day and eat a bunch of crap, yet be considered healthy and taking care of yourself by people like you, based solely on how the person looks. While a fatty is just an unhealthy lazy slob with no concern for what they stuff in their unhealthy pig face?

When I look at myself, I see baby weight, stretch marks, wrinkles, scars. I couldn&#8217;t wrap my brain around how much he loves my body. It&#8217;s taken a couple years, but now I actually believe him when he sings my praises. I don&#8217;t agree with his opinion, but I learned that je doesn&#8217;t want to hear me gripe about my body. He thinks I&#8217;m the mosy beautiful woman in the world. I think he is the sexiest man alive. So, we aleargree to let each other enjoy the other &#8216;veno questions or complaints. He finally got through to me when he told me that it hurts him when I diss my body. He told me that I can&#8217;t change the way he sees me. Even though I don&#8217;t like my body, I&#8217;ve learned to just let him love me. It actually feels good now and my confidence is higher knowing that he doesn&#8217;t give a rats ass about my flaws. If he wants to love my curves and dimples, by all means , do it. I&#8217;ve never been as comfortable physically with anyone else, even before I had kids and was 60-70 thinner. I wouldn&#8217;t trade the</p>

If we love it,  believe us and forget about what we look at on TV or magazine etc.  If we are hot for you,  we are hot for you. The only thing you could do is ruin that with your negativity. We love your imperfections.</p>

I like black women but not all black women. I like short women but not all short women. I like white women, strong-willed women, etc, but I don&#8217;t like all women that can check that one box.</p>
<p>Something else besides your size could have possibly changed to make his behavior change. If your weight/size are the only real difference, take a look at yourself. Do you look significantly different now? Like is it enough of a difference to make you still look like yourself yet like a different person at the same time? Some men may really be without limits and would love a woman that would even double/triple in weight. Others have their limits.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all uniform either. Every 400 lb woman isn&#8217;t going to be equally attractive. There are some absolutely attractive and sexy women at the higher end of the scale, but there are just as many (if not more) that don&#8217;t look so hot (to me anyways). </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to fat shame or tell anyone that they aren&#8217;t beautiful because of their weight but that men are attracted to women based upon their unique and womanly traits (as this article so wonderfully points out). Those physical attributes change as you increase or decrease in weight. They can sometimes become stronger or weaker, it really depends upon what the man liked. You need to talk to him to figure out what&#8217;s going on.</p>

I mean, my ex-wife used to tell everybody she was on a diet, she wasn&#8217;t eating, but she wasn&#8217;t losing weight.<br />
I&#8217;d go to work in the morning, there would be a family-size bag of chips in the pantry, and a tub of chip dip in the fridge. I&#8217;d come home, and the empty bag of chips would be in the trash, with the empty tub of dip&#8230;but she &#8220;hadn&#8217;t eaten anything all day&#8221; This happened so many times, that I just kept buying chips and dip, and blowing off most of what she had to say on the subject. (and no, she was home alone most days. There were no kids in the house.)</p>

Crazy, right? Yeah, that was then.

I thought no man could ever love me because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to see past the hair. Since even before I was sexually active, I have been shaving my whole entire body several times a year for special events, before going swimming, whenever I had to dress up, etc. </p>
<p>My man thinks I am the sexiest woman in the city. I love him so much. I still shave my whole body sometimes, but when I do I do it because it makes me feel good about myself, sexy and beautiful, and it is a treat for my love to feel sexy soft and smooth skin all over, but not because I feel that he could not enjoy my body otherwise. I no longer see it as a punishment. I no longer see myself as manly or masculine. My whole self perception and identity has changed from having somebody who loves me for me and teaches me daily how to love myself.</p>

I, instead, developed broader shoulders thanks to the testosterone and got -every- other symptom (And more!).  I&#8217;ve been with my husband for over 15 years and he still insists he loves everything about me &#8211; even the stuff I hate.  He doesn&#8217;t see it, it doesn&#8217;t matter to him.  Even when I put on a whole bunch of extra weight (That I am now over 50lbs into losing), he didn&#8217;t even realize I&#8217;d put on the extra pounds.  He was shocked to find out I&#8217;d gained so much, but he still didn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>This article is spot on, though.  A man in love sees you in a light that you could never understand &#8211; learning to just accept that his vision will forever be blurred to what you think is the brutal reality is the best way to handle it.</p>

Here was my reply to that: I&#8217;m a tenacious something or other. I will try the impossible yet there is one thing that sometimes will stun me for a moment or two or days. Rejection. I expect success and to get what I want all else be damned. Rejection for me is being told &#8216;No.&#8217; You can&#8217;t have that thing or person. I want to know why? When I can&#8217;t know the reason this is what does it for me. So I guess it is not so much rejection as it is when the reason for the &#8216;No.&#8217; is not disclosed. I&#8217;ve built a defense mechanism if I detect foul play. I&#8217;ll strike first &#8211; walk run or shy away. Hmm.</p>
<p>When it comes being comfortable with my physical flaws I&#8217;m not 100% sure I can believe a man who is passionately in love with &#8216;me&#8217; will do so if I am not at least close to the woman he has imagined being with. I think like an artist most of the time and see physical beauty differently than most. I would hope that a like-minded man might be able to see beyond my not being a size zero or have the flattest abs. That he&#8217;d be too enamored with my ample breasts and strong legs that grip him in the most delicious ways in the heat of the moment. Ironically men notice my eyes and smile BEFORE their gaze travels below the neck;)</p>
