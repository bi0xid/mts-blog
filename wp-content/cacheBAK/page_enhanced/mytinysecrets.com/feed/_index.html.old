<h4><b><i>“It is important women become aware of the power, purpose and potential of the amazing uterus, so we can improve and maintain the health and vitality of this wonderful female organ!”</i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>We have all been intimately acquainted with the uterus, since the dawn of our lives, whether or not you have one in your body.</p>
<p>Indeed, every single human that has ever walked upon this planet owes their very existence to this amazing organ!</p>
<h2>The Uterus: An Endangered Organ</h2>
<p>The uterus is permeable and sensitive to the industrial chemicals now inundating our environment. Hundreds of toxic chemicals are now finding their way into the wombs of women, and thus into the amniotic fluid of pregnant mothers and detectable in the blood of newborns.</p>
<p>However, the uterus has become an endangered organ.</p>
<p>Hysterectomy (the removal of the uterus) is currently the #2 most common surgery performed in the United States. The #1 most common surgery in the US today is Cesarean Section, the cutting of the uterus to remove a baby.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8921" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uterus3.jpg" alt="Uterus" width="800" height="300" /></p>
<p>It is important that we all become aware of the power, purpose and potential of the amazing uterus, so we can improve and maintain the health and vitality of this wonderful female organ!</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>Women can use the power of our wombs not just to grow babies, but to tune into the creative potential of the Universe and birth great ideas, businesses, projects, art and more. The womb is a women’s unique connection to a primal source of creativity and can be used for not just procreation but conscious co-creation with nature and spirit.</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<h2><b>7 Amazing Facts About The Womb!<br />
</b></h2>
<h4>#1 The Uterus is Super Strong</h4>
<p>The uterus is the strongest muscle in the body by weight. A woman’s womb has multiple layers of muscle tissue that run in every direction, spiral together, and are ultra-strong.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>A laboring uterus exerts incredible pressure to push a baby out into the world, and is the strongest force exerted by any muscle in the body!</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records lists the jaw muscle as the strongest muscle in the body due to a biting contest that measured pressure, but that’s just because people haven’t thought up a good way to make measuring the power of a women’s uterus in labor into a contest. Some people don’t value the uterus as the strongest muscle because not everyone has them (ahem, men) but that doesn’t mean it’s not still the strongest.</p>
<p><strong>We women know what’s up. Womb power &#8211; that’s what!</strong></p>
<h4><b>#2 The Uterus is Incredibly Flexible</b></h4>
<p>During pregnancy, a women’s uterus goes from being the size of a pear and tucked behind the pubic bone, to being as large as a balloon, reaching all the way to the ribcage and stretching the abdomen outwards. After birth, it shrinks back down to it’s normal size &#8211; amazing! Not only is the uterus super strong but it’s super stretchy too!</p>
<h4><b>#3 The Uterus Heals</b></h4>
<p>Menstrual blood is rich in stem cells which are found to be adaptive within the body to heal a wide variety of diseases. Each month during her fertile years, a woman’s body creates a rich endometrial layer in preparation to grow and nourish new life. When a baby is not conceived, the body releases this extremely valuable and nutritive substance during the menstrual cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>The abundance of stem cells in the menstrual blood are being researched to treat a wide variety of conditions from stroke, heart disease, Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s disease, and diabetes, to neurodegenerative diseases and more.</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Women’s bodies are the most abundant, free source of stem cells during monthly menstrual flows &#8211; a much more ethical way to harvest these cells rather than from cord blood of newborns or from aborted embryos. And yet, this idea has not caught on due to cultural taboos surrounding menstruation.</p>
<h4><b>#4 The Uterus is Orgasmic</b></h4>
<p>When a women has an <a title="The Sacred Power Of Your Yoni (Full Body Orgasm, Cervical- &amp; Multiple Orgasm)" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-sacred-power-of-your-yoni-full-body-orgasm-cervical-orgasm-multiple-orgasm/" target="_blank">orgasm</a>, she experiences not just pleasurable and euphoric sensations, but waves of contracting muscles throughout the uterus, as well as the vagina and pelvic floor. The whole uterus contracts, which helps to carry sperm from the vagina into the uterus.</p>
<h4><b>#5 The Uterus is Connected to the Universe</b></h4>
<p>A women’s <a title="The Secret Power Of Your Period Revealed" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-secret-power-of-your-period-revealed/" target="_blank">menstrual cycles</a> and stages of life are directly linked to the cycles of the Earth, Moon and Sun. The moon cycle is 29.5 days, and the average woman’s menstrual cycle is 29.5 days. Women who’s cycles are closest to the 29.5 day cycle have higher rates of fertility.</p>
<p><a href="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/moon.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2840" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/moon.jpg" alt="Moon cycles" width="800" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, there are 13 <a title="The Secret Power of Sex During the New Moon" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-secret-power-of-sex-during-the-new-moon/" target="_blank">moon cycles</a> in a calendar year, and the average age of menarche (a girl’s first menstruation) is age 13. The average age of menopause is 52, which is also the number of weeks in a year. There are an average of 4 weeks to a women’s menstrual cycle and 4 seasons in a year.</p>
<p>Women’s ancient menstrual calendars consisted of notches carved into bone or stone, and are said to be some of the earliest forms of calendars known. Indeed, women’s wombs hold a powerful connection to the entire Cosmos!</p>
<h4><b>#6 The Uterus Can Grow a Placenta</b></h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>The uterus is the only organ that can grow a whole new organ within it.</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The placenta is absolutely amazing, and is an organ that is grown within the uterus when a woman is pregnant that nourishes and feeds the fetus exactly what it needs for the entire pregnancy.</p>
<p>The placenta is attached to the uterine wall of the mother, and to the baby through the umbilical cord. It is a physical manifestation of the nurturing of the mother for the child and is released after the baby is born.</p>
<p>The placenta and umbilical cord have a pattern visible in the arteries that looks like the tree of life and is an ancient symbol of life and vitality.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8922" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/treeoflife1.jpg" alt="Tree of life placenta" width="800" height="300" /></p>
<p>Placentas have been highly honored by cultures around the world since the beginning of humanity.</p>
<p>The word “placenta” comes from Old English and actually means “a round flat cake”, and the tradition of honoring our placenta continues today as we celebrate around a birthday cake each year on the anniversary of our birth.</p>
<h4><b>#7 The Uterus Can Grow a WHOLE PERSON!</b></h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>Within the womb of a woman is the potential to conceive and gestate a whole new human being &#8211; amazing!!</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Every single one of us is here alive on the planet today because we started life in our mother’s womb.</p>
<p>The first time I attended a birth as a doula, I was totally amazed at the power of a woman to birth a baby, and walked around for days in total amazement at every woman I saw, thinking how miraculous our wombs are!</p>
<p><strong>Now you know why they called her WONDER Woman!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<h4><b><i>“A woman in tune with her ovarian energy has a greater capacity to utilize her fertility and creativity to meet her needs as well as her desires.”</i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>During embryological development, all of the eggs that a woman will release in her lifetime are developed while she is in her mothers’ womb. This means that the very egg that we all developed from (male and female alike), was developed inside of our mothers’ ovaries while she was in her mother’s womb. Literally, the seed of life you came from was first formed in your grandmothers’ womb!</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><b><i>“The ovaries connect us to our ancestors through the lineage of the grandmothers &#8211; that special womanly wisdom handed down from generation to generation since the beginning of time.”</i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Within 3 months of a woman conceiving a child, the most current genetic material in her body is imprinted upon her eggs so that her child will have the most relevant information to grow from. In fact, all of the experiences &#8211; the joys and the pains &#8211; our grandmothers and mothers lived through are passed on to us for our evolution and growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><b><i>“When the energy of the ovaries is charged up and circulating in a woman, she has the ability to use her feminine power to heal and choose what potentials she creates in her life on every level.”</i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to live a life of wellness and tap into her creative &amp; orgasmic energy, a woman must reclaim her ovarian palace and rejoice in this inner kingdom of pure potentiality. This can only be achieved by nurturing the flow of energy there, consciously guiding its light into expression in and around her body.</p>
<h2><b>Ovarian Breathing: A Step-By-Step Guide<br />
</b></h2>
<p>Use this exercise to awaken your intuition and unlock the wisdom of your ovaries!</p>
<h4><b>#1 Connect to Your Ovaries</b></h4>
<p>Place your hands over your ovaries &#8211; just below and on either side of the belly button &#8211; with your fingertips pointing downward over the pubic bone, thumbs touching gently together near the navel, creating an inverted triangle over the ovaries.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8889" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/breathing.jpg" alt="Ovary Breathing" width="800" height="300" /></p>
<h4><b>#2 </b><b>Breathe</b></h4>
<p>Sit quietly and rest your tongue gently on the roof of your mouth, with your jaw and pelvis relaxed. Begin breathing deeply, focusing energy to your heart.</p>
<h4><b>#3 </b><b>Focus </b></h4>
<p>Now, focus on sending energy down to your ovaries, until you feel the energy expand and warm under your hands.</p>
<h4><b>#4 Tune in </b></h4>
<p>Enjoy the rhythms and movement here and let yourself go even deeper into the flow of silence.</p>
<h4><b>#5 </b><b>Use A</b><b>ffirmations</b></h4>
<p>Say out loud:</p>
<p><em>“I honor and invite the sacred wisdom of my Ovarian Palace to surface now. Please guide me into my own healing in a way that will serve me with the most love. Thank you”</em>.</p>
<p>Repeat this sacred mantra in your heart and in your mind &#8211; or create your own personal affirmation!</p>
<h4><b>#6 </b><b>Listen </b></h4>
<p>While you are focused on the space under your hands, listen to your inner wisdom and allow whatever visions, feelings or memories that come up to the surface and flow through you.</p>
<h4><b>#7 Accept</b></h4>
<p>Bring a sense of love and acceptance to whatever comes up for you. Using your breath, circulate your newfound ovarian energy to any part of the body that needs healing. Use your throat to exhale sounds that clear these energies from the body, mind, and heart for as long as needed.</p>
<h4><b>#8 Visualize</b></h4>
<p>While you are breathing into your ovaries, visualize a continuous flow of this loving energy moving in and around each of your ovaries and around your sacred feminine center.</p>
<h4><b>#9 </b><b>Be Present</b></h4>
<p>Draw your awareness up to the heart center and let the glow of your radiance surge through your entire body.</p>
<h4><b>#10 </b><b>Journal</b></h4>
<p>Journal about your experience of tuning in to your ovarian palace. Write about any creative ideas you wish to nurture with your love and creativity.</p>
<h2><b>Create a Monthly Ritual</b></h2>
<p>Practice ovarian breathing at least once every <a title="The Secret Power of Sex During the New Moon" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-secret-power-of-sex-during-the-new-moon/" target="_blank">moon cycle</a> or during your <a title="The Secret Power Of Your Period Revealed" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-secret-power-of-your-period-revealed/" target="_blank">menstrual cycle</a>, so that you can develop a deeper relationship with your body by returning to the rhythm of your sacred self as you change and grow (<b>except</b> during ovulation, due to the already stimulated energy of that time).</p>
<p>After practicing ovarian breathing, you can expect to feel more creative and fertile in all ways, so be conscious of your procreation capacity, reclaim your power to choose what you create, and have fun with this sacred practice!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<input class="jpibfi" type="hidden" ><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8853" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Delphin-Enjolras-Nu-Etendu-au-Bouquet-de-Roses1.jpg" alt="Delphin-Enjolras-Nu-Etendu-au-Bouquet-de-Roses" width="850" height="350" /></p>
<blockquote>
<h4><b><i>“If you want to be the kind of lover women never forget, then it’s time to seriously educate yourself on the art of sex. An erection is not enough to make us feel the depth of your energetic being as a man, nor to connect us to higher planes.” </i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>women are not less sexual than men, we’re just wired differently.</strong></p>
<p>While men can get an erection and go from zero to hero in less than five minutes, most women need a whole heck of a lot more than that to feel sexually satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s get one thing straight: women love sex.</strong> So, if you ever hear a woman talking about sex like it’s a chore &#8211; as if she’d rather vacuum or tidy up the house &#8211; she’s having the wrong kind of sex.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Men, do you want to see your woman’s body convulsing in orgasms? Do you want to hear her screaming in ecstasy, so loud that the neighbors can hear?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Then listen up! Women are drawn to capable men who actually care about what they do and how they do it.</p>
<h2><b>CONSCIOUSLY AWAKE WOMEN WANT MORE THAN PHYSICAL SEX<br />
</b></h2>
<blockquote>
<h5><b><i>“Consciously awake women want </i></b><b><i>more than physical sex</i></b>. <b><i>It’s an exploration of connection, energy, passion, and transcendental states.”</i></b></h5>
</blockquote>
<p>You are more than your physical body, which is but one level of your existence. In addition to what you understand as your body (head, arms, feet, organs, etc.), you also possess an energetic body.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8848" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/energeticbody1.jpg" alt="Energetic Body" width="800" height="300" /></p>
<p>Physical sex will only take you so far. It’s surface level with very little depth. This is the type of sex most everyone is having, as it doesn’t require much skill &#8211; but it’s boring!</p>
<p>When two people connect energetically &#8211; not just physically &#8211;  MAGIC happens. Energy vibrates at high frequencies as it courses through our bodies, making sex a complete physical high.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5><em>&#8220;Consciously awake sex transcends basic sex on ALL LEVELS. It’s raw. It’s primal. This type of sex is Cosmic!&#8221;</em></h5>
</blockquote>
<p>If you really want to experience the depths of your lover, you have to go beyond the physical and into your energetic body. Then you can tap into deeper states of ecstasy and pleasure you once thought existed only in dreams!</p>
<h2><b>6 THINGS CONSCIOUSLY AWAKE WOMEN WANT FROM MEN</b></h2>
<h4><strong>#1 Emotional Vulnerability</strong></h4>
<p>Men who are emotionally disconnected are hard to feel energetically. An erection is not enough to make us feel the depth of your energetic being as a man, nor to connect us to higher planes.</p>
<p>We need to feel energy emanating from your body, and this requires you to open your heart.</p>
<p><strong>MEN!! Be willing to dive into the fire of your Soul. Connect to your deeper purpose. Live from this place.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>#2 Passion</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Passionate men cannot be underrated. A man who pursues his desires passionately says far more about him as a lover than you can imagine.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A passionate lover will have conscious hands. He is the type of man that looks deep into our eyes, through our heart, and into our Soul. He will listen to her pulse, feel the rhythms of her body, and tune in to her energy.</p>
<h4><b>#3 </b><b>Skills</b></h4>
<p>Consciously awake women have no patience for men who won’t invest their time and resources into understanding what it takes to be an amazing lover.</p>
<p>Men who take pride in the skills they have take their time and treat their lover’s body like a temple. These men are the kind of men that understand the alchemy of sexuality.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>After all, if you want a great lover, you need to be a great lover!</em></p></blockquote>
<h4><b>#4 </b><b>Variety</b></h4>
<p>“On top”, missionary, and “from behind” are not the end all &#8211; be all of sex. Don’t get monotonous. Be creative and adventurous!</p>
<p>Take time to explore what your lover wants, and if you have a hard time feeling her out, ask questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5><em><b>Remember</b>: All women are not created equal. We’re diverse in how we feel and what we want. The shape of a woman’s vagina will make certain positions more pleasing for some over others. Learn what your woman loves &#8211; which positions work and why.</em></h5>
</blockquote>
<p>A word of caution: If you are adventurous or kinky don’t connect with someone who isn’t. You need to choose lovers that have the same level of openness as you do.</p>
<h4><b>#5 </b><b>Kissing, </b><b>touch, and the breath</b></h4>
<p>Kissing is one of the most erotic forms of sexuality and can fuel so much passion between lovers. In fact, kissing alone can unlock energetic bodies.</p>
<p>Feel into us. Let us feel your weight and your strength. We aren’t fragile. Let us feel your presence. There is healing and sensuality in touch.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5><strong><em>It takes practice and Conscious Awareness to unlock the layers of our bodies we keep blocked most of the time.</em></strong></h5>
</blockquote>
<p>Kissing, feeling, and breath can help us release the energetic body. Use mindful awareness to connect on a much deeper level.</p>
<h4><b>#6 </b><b>Intimacy</b></h4>
<blockquote><p><em>Quickies are fair game… sometimes. There’s a time and a place for it. However true intimacy is not created while in a hurry &#8211; slow down! </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Let go of the usual focus on achieving orgasm, and instead, feel into the entire experience: the dance, exchange and mixing of energy, the alchemy of two souls aligning in physical ecstasy.</p>
<p>So if you want women who crave you sexually and have orgasms that shake the walls, then try the Consciously Awake Route. You’ll thank me later.</p>
<p>Peace. Love. And LOTS of hot (conscious) sex!</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Today, if you are man with any degree of sensitivity, it is a vulnerable thing to penetrate a woman.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>It stands to reason that in love-making, on the surface at least, it is the woman, ‘the penetrated one’, who holds the vulnerability. After all, having a man push himself into your most sacred and sensitive opening is about the most surrendered and yielding experience one can imagine.</p>
<p>So it’s understandable that while women are in the ‘receiving’ role sexually, and are also usually less physically strong than their male partners, the vulnerability is held by the women.</p>
<p>I’d like to connect with you deeper in this vulnerability and share something I haven’t spoken about before.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>It is Extremely Vulnerable For Us Men To Be The ‘Penetrator’ Too.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as we work on raising our sensitivities and empathy to women, unless we enjoy our own anal penetration, we don’t know what it’s like to be ‘pushed into’.</p>
<p>Today, the social climate around men’s sexuality includes a lot of past trauma from abusive and violent sex or just insensitive or immature men of previous generations who had no clue what they were doing to <em>their</em> women.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Today’s women bear the scars of past, male-dominated, unfeeling sexual experiences and it has only been very recently that the law and society’s moral compass has even acknowledged a woman’s right so say “No” even in the middle of sex and even if she’s married to the man she’s having sex with.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Unbelievably, still, in most countries there is no law against a man raping his wife. She has no legal right to refuse him and no legal protection if he rapes her.</p>
<p>Even in USA and UK the law has only been passed to protect married women in the last 50 years or so, and across Asia and Africa they think I’m crazy to even bring the subject up.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>The Idea That Men Could Be The Vulnerable Ones In Love-making May Sound Puzzling At First.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>But I want to express that as a man, carrying the burden of women’s often negative expectations and the ever-felt sexual wounds of all mistreated women of the past, creates a very unique and sensitive vulnerability of it’s own &#8211; for the men.</p>
<p>Perhaps it could be likened to German grandchildren of the Nazis who themselves played no part in the abuses of WW2 but in the post war decades couldn’t help being tarred by the same brush and unjustly carrying some of the guilt and rejection.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Men carry the shame of our abusive, sexually incontinent forefathers and we don’t want to bring that trauma into the bedroom any more. It’s in the way of us having incredible, heart-bursting sex with you.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Today, if you are man with any degree of sensitivity, it is a vulnerable thing to penetrate a woman.</p>
<p>I don’t want to abuse you, trigger you into past trauma or in any way mistranslate your wants or needs. I would hate to accidentally touch you in a way that jarred you or misread your passion. So, if you notice my hesitancy or any held-back-ness, please do not translate this as any lack of desire on my part. I may be waiting for a clearer invitation.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Women, Please Invite Us Clearly And Unmistakably To Make Love With You.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Only when we are certain that your invitation is wholehearted and clear can we melt into devotional service to your pleasure. We need to be total, unbridled by doubt, to allow the strength of our male physicality to take you.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>We want to explode you into light and usher you to the door where you can dissolve into pure sex with the Big Spirit – in the field that is beyond us both, but until we are certain that Your invitation is total, we can’t surrender to giving you our gifts fully.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Your vulnerability is my vulnerability. Let’s melt deeper into it together and heal the past traumas with our love-making.</p>

<h4><em><strong>Go ahead, girl: twerk! This may be the most Spiritual and healing thing you do all day. Yes my dear, twerking is sacred!</strong></em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Twerking has become popular and well known, thanks to Myley Cyrus and her infamous performance at the 2013 VMA&#8217;s. Unfortunately, her embarrassing display has given this ancient dance a bad reputation.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>the movements associated with twerking are not new </strong>(<i>even the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twerking" target="_blank">‘twerk’</a> has been around for a while</i>)</p>
<h2>THE ANCIENT ORIGINS OF TWERKING</h2>
<p>Twerking is a set of dance moves that originated in West Africa (particularly amongst the Mapouka people of Ivory Coast), and spread throughout the African Diaspora.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/M_aovs7PVx4?feature=player_detailpage" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><b>Need proof?</b> Take an African or Afro-Caribbean dance class, and you’ll notice that most of the moves are isolated in the hips, pelvis and buttocks &#8211; the same muscles used to twerk.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>“If women consciously did these dance moves not as props in music videos, but in sacred, healing womens’ circles (or in the loving presence of our partners), it would empower us to reclaim our health and our sexuality.”</em></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<h2>3 REASONS YOU SHOULD START TWERKING</h2>
<h3><b>#1 Twerking strengthens your pelvic floor muscles<br />
</b></h3>
<p>The parts of the body used to twerk build muscle and control of the pelvic floor, while also strengthening the core. It’s also an intense workout that can give you a sexy physique and make your booty look<b><i> extra juicy! </i></b>So bend over and contract your booty muscles, then let them go and <b><i>drop it like it’s hot! </i></b></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cJeUmuh2lLY?feature=player_detailpage" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3><b>#2 Twerking heals your reproductive health<br />
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<h5><b><i>“Moving the hips increases energy flow, releasing stagnant chi (or life force energy) and helping to alleviate issues such as fibroids and menstrual cramps &#8211; both a result of contracted energy in the lower abdomen.”</i></b></h5>
</blockquote>
<p>The moves performed in twerking, and other similar dances, can help to heal the female reproductive system. Strengthening these muscles helps to ease childbirth and prevent disorders such as urinary incontinence and pelvic prolapse.</p>
<p>Twerk daily and relieve yourself of the need to pop Motrins while on your monthly!</p>
<h3><b>#3 Twerking balances your lower chakras<br />
</b></h3>
<p>In Chinese Taoism, the lower tantian (energy center) &#8211; located three finger widths below the navel &#8211; is where our life force and sexual energy are stored and generated. It is also known as the root chakra, a major area of focus in martial arts. When this area is strong, we have increased energy to support our physical and spiritual bodies.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8816" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dantien.jpg" alt="Dantien - Tantien" width="800" height="300" /></p>
<blockquote>
<h5>In the Indian Tantra tradition, these dances circulate energy through our first and second chakras, which are connected to our feelings of security and creativity, respectively.</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>When these chakras are balanced, it strengthens our connection to our sensuality and abundance. In both Tantra and Taoism, once our sexual energy is generated, it can be channeled to higher Spiritual centers, expanding our consciousness to a state of Divine bliss!</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>So let’s reclaim twerking for what it is: a sacred practice for feminine health and sexual empowerment. Now go put on some music and <b><i>back that thang up! </i></b></h5>
</blockquote>

<h4>I&#8217;ve come across this very disturbing article on a &#8220;zombie&#8221; guy named Julien Blanc, who teaches other zombie guys how to emotionally &amp; physically manipulate women into having sex.. some call this sexual abuse. Yes.. and he was teaching it freely ..until a couple of days ago.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>I usually do not share &#8220;news&#8221; on <em>mytinysecrets.com</em> but this one has to be shared. Let&#8217;s join forces to help stop this madness.</p>
<p>Check out the following article. <em>{I really can&#8217;t believe some guys listened to this BS.}</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><em>The article appeared first on <a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org/" target="_blank">ADDICTING INFO</a></em></p>
<p>&#8220;Self-described pick-up artist who coaches men in the sexual abuse of women is being given a lesson in karma as a global internet campaign threatens to drive him out of business, permanently.</p>
<p>If you’ve not yet come across the insidious ‘Pick-Up Artist’ community, lucky you.</p>
<p>Basically, men pay other men like Julien Blanc up to $3,000 a course to learn how to emotionally, and in many cases, physically manipulate women into having sex with them.</p>
<p>Blanc, a consultant for <span class="storyTop "> Real Social Dynamics (RSD)</span>, travels around the world dispensing this disturbing advice.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>One of Blanc’s tactics for ‘breaking the ice’ is to grab the heads of female strangers and thrust them toward his crotch.  Another of his ‘approaches’ is to grab women in a choke-hold, while he puts his finger on his lips and whispers ‘Shh’.</h5>
</blockquote>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/grV1iDns87s?feature=player_detailpage" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>“If you’re a white male, you can do what you want. I’m just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls’ heads, just like, head, pfft on the dick.”</p></blockquote>
<p>At his seminar <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMurdochTimes/status/530568721086312449/photo/1">‘</a>How to Control Women’, Blanc shared this slide during a section entitled ‘How to Make her Stay&#8217;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8769" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slide.jpg" alt="Julien Blanc" width="600" height="605" /></p>
<h2>This is a manifesto for the physical and emotional abuse of women.</h2>
<p>But Blanc is not the RSD’s only sexual predator.</p>
<p>Below is a video of RSD founder Owen Tyler gleefully recounting the time he raped a woman. He tells his audience of giggling, inadequate men:</p>
<blockquote><p>“She was Thai, she was a stripper. I just fucking hated that bitch. She was just a full slut whore slut. I fucked the shit out of her dude. The last time I fucked her…it was in the morning…she was in the shower…I think she didn’t wanna have sex again.  But I just like fucking threw her on the bed. I remember, I put it in her…I could barely even get it in because she was totally not in the mood…And I was like ‘Fuck it! I’m never seeing this bitch again, I don’t care! So I just like jam it in…it’s all like tight and dry (laughs) and I’m all like, make it quick cos she doesn’t even want it”</p></blockquote>
<p>He was clear she didn’t want sex, he physically dominated her to create the opportunity for sex, he knew she was not in a state of arousal as he penetrated her – and he chose to continue anyway. Why? Did it sound to you like he enjoyed this as a physically pleasurable sexual experience? Or was in an act of proprietous hatred?</p>
<h2>The Storm Against Julien Blanc {#TakeDownJulienBlanc}</h2>
<p>Online activist Jenn Li was so appalled by what she saw in these videos that she made a decision &#8211; she was going to take on Julien Blanc and RSD.  It was not enough to be mad; someone needed to take responsibility for ending this outrage.  So she did.</p>
<p><span class="skimlinks-unlinked">She</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30ZWKn6JBxg" target="_blank"> launched an online petition, writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Julien Blanc is a sexist and racist “pick up artist,” who has made a living by teaching men how to violate women through physical and emotional abuse.</p>
<p>“Do not associate your hotel’s good name with a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game. Please stand with the women of Australia and women everywhere, and do not host an event where men are being taught how to violate and harass women.”</p></blockquote>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-como-melbourne-hotel-take-down-julien-blanc-and-rsd-s-seminars-and-web-content-takedownjulienblanc">30,000</a> people have signed the petition so far, and thousands more from across the world joined her at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23takedownjulienblanc&amp;src=tyah">#TakeDownJulienBlanc</a>.</p>
<h4>The Activists have Successfully Ended his Australian Tour</h4>
<ul>
<li>Online feminist groups such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DestroyTheJoint?fref=ts">Destroy the Joint</a> launched viral campaigns lobbying venues and ticketing websites to drop Blanc’s events, and they won.</li>
<li>Firstly, <a href="http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/news-features/more-venues-refuse-to-host-pickup-artist-julien-blanc-thanks-to--takedownjulienblanc-campaign-20141106-3jpjq.html">EventBrite</a> will no longer sell tickets for Blanc’s seminars,</li>
<li>then Marriot Hotel and other venues began cancelling events, and</li>
<li>finally the Australian Immigration actually removed Blanc’s Visa, kicking him out of the country entirely.</li>
</ul>
<p>The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, said Blanc’s visa was cancelled Thursday night.</p>
<h5><em>We must ask ourselves too: </em></h5>
<h5><em>what kind of society is it that produces such men, and how do we stop?&#8221;</em></h5>
<p><em>via <a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org" target="_blank">http://www.addictinginfo.org</a></em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>A great way to stop such things is by offering holistic Sex &amp; Love education. Men and women must learn to re-connect &amp; harmonize again as nature intended it. Sexually, Emotionally &amp; Spiritually.</p>
<p>Women must rise to see all their glory, strength &amp; wisdom. Women are the source of creation in the micro- and macrocosm. We must stop to act small. <a href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-awakening-man-a-guide-to-become-a-conscious-powerful-man/">Men must rise to awaken to their true glory and power and to activate their true divine masculine qualities</a>.</p>
<p>Please help spread this information to support those who try to stop Julien Blanc and the movement.</p>
<p>Much love, Adina</p>

<h4><em>“Nakedness is about vulnerability, and vulnerability is where our true power lies.”</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The clothes we wear allow us to create an image of ourselves we want the world to see. They are like a social armor, offering us a false sense of protection. Without them, we are stripped bare of all the social masks we hide behind.</p>
<p>In other words, without our clothes, we are <strong>real, authentic, and vulnerable.</strong></p>
<p>We are<b> <i>Soul naked.</i></b></p>
<h2><strong>THE POWER OF NAKED YOGA<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Nude yoga is a celebration of the strength and beauty of the raw, authentic human form, as you will see in these touching images. They are a reminder of power we find deep within when we courageously embrace our own vulnerability.</p>
<p>The emotions captured in these pictures will move you, and maybe even inspire you to <b><i>give naked yoga try! </i></b></p>

<blockquote>
<h4><b><i>“</i></b>This new warrior is noble and kind-hearted, protective, and honourable. He is also sensitive, yet not fragile. He is conscious, powerful, masculine, and Divine.<b><i>”</i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a newly awakened man emerging in the collective.</p>
<p>He has heard the call to a deeper life in which everything is a deeply felt experience and an ever-expanding awareness that moves from the heart outward.</p>
<h2>WHO IS THE AWAKENED MAN?</h2>
<h5><em><strong>&#8220;For the awakening man, community is humanity.&#8221;</strong> </em></h5>
<p>He has shifted his focus from a localized, ethnocentric perspective to a world-centric framework of perception. He has a sense of responsibility that reaches beyond self and community. He is a man whose decisions are fueled by an expansive vision of possibility for all of humankind.</p>
<h5><strong><i>“The awakening man lives from the inside out, exploring and developing his inner geography.”</i></strong></h5>
<p>More interested in inner expansion than outer achievement, the awakening man cultivates and honors his intuition. Seeking congruity between his inner life and his outer manifestations, he boldly adventures deep within, integrating the treasures he excavates into his way of being.</p>
<h5><strong><em>“The awakening man has reverence for Mother Earth. He walks upon her carefully, with conscious awareness and gratitude.”</em></strong></h5>
<p>The awakening man does not imagine himself as superior or distinct from the natural world. He understands the interconnected and interdependent nature of reality. He knows that if he does damage to the environment, he does damage to himself.</p>
<h5><strong><em>&#8220;The awakening man has reverence for the Divine Feminine &#8211; in all her forms.&#8221;</em></strong></h5>
<p>He celebrates the wonder that is woman, showing her respect, honour, and gratitude.</p>
<p>He refuses to accept the horrors perpetuated against women by the malevolent masculine, and he holds his brothers accountable. He co-creates a reality where all women can feel safe to move about freely, find their voice, and actualize their inherent magnificence in the world. Indeed, the awakening man is helping to usher in a new paradigm, where women and men stand as equal partners.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #333333;"><b><i>“The awakening man courageously embraces his vulnerability, honouring the wisdom at the heart of his pain. He is emotionally honest.” </i></b></span></h5>
<p>The awakening man is not afraid to surrender &#8211; to reality, to truth, to love, understanding that this is not a weakened form of surrender, but one that is emblazoned with courage. He consciously sheds his armour, facing his issues and unconscious patterns <i>heart on</i>, and communicates his feelings to others in a respectful way.</p>
<p>Indeed, the awakening man speaks the language of the heart.</p>
<p>Balanced between his Divine Masculine &#8211; Divine Feminine, he openly explores his capacities for receptivity and tenderness, living not as distinctly masculine or feminine, but as whole human.</p>
<h5><em><strong>&#8220;The awakening man prioritizes conscious relationship.&#8221;</strong> </em></h5>
<p>He <a title="Are You In A Sacred Relationship?" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/are-you-in-a-sacred-relationship/">values authentic co-creation</a>. He honours relationship as spiritual practice. He seeks <a title="How to Truly Satisfy a Woman: 5 Tips to Become Her Best Lover Everrrrrr!" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/how-to-truly-satisfy-a-woman-5-tips-to-become-her-best-lover-everrrrrr/">physical intimacy that is deeply vulnerable and consciously connected</a>.He is attuned, engaged and healthily boundaried. When relationship challenges arise, he courageously works through any blocks to intimacy, boldly standing in the heartfire.</p>
<h5><strong><em>&#8220;The awakening man values spiritual freedom.&#8221;</em> </strong></h5>
<p>His Spirituality is tolerant, respectful, and all inclusive, honouring all paths to God, so long they are respectful of others. He accepts those who believe, and those who don’t, and condemns any path that uses religious differences as a justification for destruction.</p>
<h5><strong><em>&#8220;The awakening man is empowered from within.&#8221; </em></strong></h5>
<p>He is empowered but he does not exploit power.<i> </i></p>
<p>The evolved man derives his power from his connection to source, not from power over others. And he neither competes for competition’s sake, nor accumulates for the sake of accumulation. Instead, he consciously chooses to share abundance and give back to his community, ever mindful of his impact on humanity.</p>
<h5><b><i>“The awakening man leads a purpose-full existence.”</i></b></h5>
<p>No longer satisfied with survival alone, the newly emerging awakening man’s ambitions are rooted in higher considerations: his sacred purpose. This is what energizes him, not the machinations an unhealthy ego.</p>
<h5><strong><em>&#8220;The awakening man is not externally derived &#8211; he is authentically sourced.&#8221;</em></strong></h5>
<p>He does not compare himself to others, nor does he adapt his personality to the dictates of the crowd. He stands in his own centre, respectful of others but not defined by them. He works diligently to liberate his consciousness from the egoic ties that bind.</p>
<p>He has become his own benchmark, valuing authenticity over image. He is the sculptor of his own reality.</p>
<h5><b><i>“The awakening man embodies the highest standard of integrity in his words and deeds.</i></b></h5>
<p>The awakening man makes a sustained effort to work through anything that is not in alignment with his integrity. He honours his word, even at his own expense, holding himself accountable for his actions and their effects. Neither sidestepping or blaming, he owns his misdeeds, and makes amends for them.<i> </i></p>
<h5><em><strong>&#8220;The awakening man seeks wholeness</strong>.&#8221;</em></h5>
<p>No longer attached to archaic, linear notions of masculinity, the newly awakening man strives for a healthy balance between the Divine masculine and the Divine feminine. He seeks a holistic way of being that reflects both of these archetypes, and is comfortable using both as he moves through life.</p>
<h5><em><strong>&#8220;The awakening man is a warrior of the heart.&#8221;</strong></em></h5>
<p>After too many lifetimes of fighting, a benevolent warrior is being birthed on the planet. He honours the warrior capacity for assertiveness, yet he is not arbitrarily aggressive, moving instead from a space of love and compassion.</p>
<p>This new warrior is noble and kind-hearted, protective, and honourable.</p>
<p>He is also sensitive, yet not fragile.</p>
<p>He is conscious, powerful, masculine, and Divine.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4><em>Many of us women in today’s goal focused world are so stuck in our heads that we are disconnected from our cunts. Our masculine dominant lifestyles have taken us out of alignment with what is both necessary and nourishing to our femininity.</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of this lack of connection to our pussies, many of us are so resistant to the flow of erotic energy that we struggle to feel anything during sex. But don’t worry &#8211; with mindful awareness and consistent practice, you can <i>change</i> all of that!</p>
<h2>THE MIND CAN BE A PLEASURE BLOCK<i></i><b><i><br />
</i></b></h2>
<p>As a Sacred Sexuality coach, I teach women the importance of pussy consciousness. With the rise of the strong feminine competing with the masculine, many of us have found it harder to let go and surrender to the feminine flow. As a result, the mind can become a pleasure block, keeping the body from opening to sexual ecstasy and bliss.</p>
<p>How do I know this? Because I, too, have experienced this and work with many women who have the same challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5> <b><i>“If the feminine is imbalanced by too much chi (life force energy) in the head, our water dries up, and we lose connection to our desires.” </i></b></h5>
</blockquote>
<p>I first recognized I was less pussy sensitive as my business started growing. My fears and expectations became more real because I was taking risks and playing a bigger game. While I was trapped in my mind and it’s need for control, my pussy was being neglected!</p>
<p>During this time, I was told by a Tantric master that <b>the mind is the masculine</b> &#8211; it is <i>fire</i>.</p>
<p><b>The womb </b>(our sex centre, and the place of our erotic yearning)<b> is the feminine</b> &#8211; it is <i>water</i>.</p>
<p>If the feminine is imbalanced by too much chi in the head, our water dries up, and we lose connection to our desires. This truly resonated for me and helped me become aware of my feminine needs for nourishment, and create balance between my masculine/feminine energies.</p>
<h2>8 SENSUAL WAYS TO BECOME MORE ORGASMIC</h2>
<p>Use these simple tips and make them a daily practice, to consciously reconnect to your pussy!</p>
<h4><b>#1 </b><b><i>Breathe</i></b></h4>
<p>Breath is one of the most important keys to connected sex. Breathe into your vagina &#8211; <b><i>your sacred sex centre</i></b> &#8211; nourishing it with life. Just like in yoga, when we breathe into an area that needs opening, it expands!</p>
<h4><b>#2 </b><b><i>Relax your jaw, mouth and throat.</i></b></h4>
<p>The jaw, mouth, and throat are directly linked to the hips and vagina.  (Notice that when you are shutting down, they are all usually tight). Soften and relax your jaw, mouth and throat. Open up, and your vagina will too!!</p>
<h4><b>#3 </b><b><i>Make sound!</i></b></h4>
<p>Like the mouth and it’s connection to the hips and vagina, the cervix is connected to the voice box &#8211; similar both look and tissue. Practice making sounds and bringing them down into your pussy. With time, you will find that certain tones vibrate (and <b><i>activate</i></b>) your sex center!</p>
<h4><b>#4 </b><b><i>Move! </i></b></h4>
<p>Energy cannot move in a stiff body &#8211; <b><i>the body needs to move to open.</i></b> Moving your hips is a great way to bring yourself into your body.To do this, lay down and arch your back enough to put a hand under, then flatten it on the floor, tilting your hips back and fourth, breathing in synch with each movement.</p>
<h4><b>#5</b><b><i>Visualize</i></b></h4>
<p>Your imagination can be a powerful tool to clear your mind and connect with your body. Picture whatever is stopping you from being present, then imagine it being released with your breath. As you inhale again, imagine you are breathing in clear white light. Once your mind is clear, visualize  your breath as a golden light moving down into your pussy, filling your womb with pure consciousness!</p>
<h4><b>#6 </b><b><i>Do your kegels!</i></b></h4>
<p>A strong pelvic floor (PC muscle) not only helps with incontinence and childbirth &#8211; it also <b><i>increases vaginal sensitivity</i></b>! So do your kegels to bring more awareness, strength, and blood flow to your sex. You can also purchase a jade egg or silicon balls that act as weights inside your yoni.</p>
<h4><b>#7 </b><b><i>Touch yourself</i></b></h4>
<p>Touch your pussy &#8211; and your body &#8211; with loving hands. Feel into every caress, exploring each part with varying pressure. Don’t aim to have an orgasm &#8211; simply connecting and being present with your yoni can be enough (and if you do have an orgasm, <b><i>even better!)</i></b><i>.</i></p>
<h4><b>#8: </b><b><i>Dance</i></b></h4>
<p>Put on some sexy music and dance, combining all the techniques above. Dancing is one of the most feminine, embodied practices a woman can do, so dance &#8211; for yourself!</p>

<blockquote>
<h4><em>“Sex is a sacred act that is Spiritual in nature. It is a silent form of worship.”</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>What do prayer and sex have in common? A lot more than you may think.</p>
<p>Whatever religion or belief system you follow, prayer is most likely a part of your spiritual practice. <strong>But what about sex?</strong></p>
<h2>THE SPIRITUALITY-SEX CONNECTION</h2>
<p>History shows that humans have used some form of ritual to express gratitude for their Creator since the earliest days of life on Earth.</p>
<p>A quick study of the world’s most revered ancient cultures (particularly, the Greeks, Egyptians and Hindus) shows that spirituality and sex were both central to life &#8211; there was no separating the two.</p>
<p>Each left behind scores of hieroglyphs and elaborately carved statues depicting men and women in various sexual positions. There&#8217;s even an Ancient Egyptian papyrus discovered in the early 19th century, that is known as the<strong> <a title="The Turin Papyrus" href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/the-turin-erotic-papyrus-the-oldest-known-depiction-of-sex-circa-1150-b-c-e.html" target="_blank">&#8216;Erotic Papyrus.&#8217; </a></strong>It was dubbed as &#8220;the world&#8217;s first men&#8217;s mag,&#8221; (<em>move over</em>, Playboy!) with several pictures of naked, contorted bodies.<strong> </strong>Clearly, our ancestors were getting it on!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8643" src="http://mtspullzone.privat.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ancientfinal.jpg" alt="Ancient Sexology" width="850" height="350" /></p>
<p>All that changed during the Victorian Era, when sexual activity was shamed as dirty and sinful by religious authorities. The subject was so taboo, even <i>talking </i>about it was frowned upon! Sadly, we are still living with the effects of this today, having lost most of our deeper understanding of lovemaking.</p>
<h2>SEX IS NOURISHING AND SOUL SATISFYING</h2>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>“Like the food we eat, sex is essential for overall health and wellbeing. It is nourishing to the mind, body, and Soul.”</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>We pray before we eat, to show our appreciation for the nourishment we are about to receive, and the hands that prepared the meal. So why don’t we give thanks for sex? After all, it is <b>JUST</b> as beneficial to our health and wellness.</p>
<p>Sex helps to strengthen the immune system, in addition to alleviating stress and <a title="The 22 Diseases You Can Heal With Passionate Sex {Incredible!}" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/the-22-diseases-you-can-heal-with-passionate-sex-incredible/" target="_blank">many other ailments</a>. Unlike other forms of exercise, it is revitalizing <i>and</i> fun! Indeed, a good session is like pressing a reset button, giving you renewed energy. With all of these amazing benefits (and many more), doesn’t it make sense to bless your partner, with whom you share such a vital and satisfying experience?</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><i>“There is something so Divine about sharing your body &#8211; in essence, your Soul &#8211; with someone.”</i><b><i> </i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<h2>HOW TO PRAY BEFORE YOU LAY</h2>
<p><b>TO THE LADIES: </b></p>
<p>Praise him for the way he uses his energy and focus to bring you pleasure. Look your lover in his eyes, and acknowledge that he has created a safe space for you, opening up to him with absolute trust. He will no doubt work that much harder to please you!</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><b><i>“The opening of her legs &#8211; and her sacred flower &#8211; is a declaration of trust.” </i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p><b>TO THE MEN:</b></p>
<p>Thank her for having faith in your ability to make her feel safe, secure, and satisfied. Worship her with every stroke!</p>
<p>When two people make love, they exchange energies that help nourish, sustain, and even heal them both physically, mentally, emotionally, <i>and </i>spiritually.</p>
<p>Sex can also help to strengthen the bond between you and your significant other. So the next time you’re with your partner and things start getting hot and heavy, pause for a moment and show some gratitude.</p>
<p>Thank your lover in advance and they will thank you in bed!</p>

<h4><b><i>“Techniques are important, but they’re nothing without a deeper understanding of women and what turns them on.”</i></b></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>As one of the most influential driving forces of any living species, sex plays a <b>huge</b> part in our lives. It can be the cause of so much pleasure, motivation, and yes – <b><i>even</i></b> frustration. Besides the obvious frustration of people that just can’t “get any,” the frustration that men <b><i>and</i></b> women have with mediocre (or just plain <i>awful</i>) sex is alarming!</p>
<p><strong>Before we get to the tips, ask yourself:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is she having multiple, earth-shattering, full body orgasms… <b><i>without you even touching her</i></b>?</li>
<li>Is she willing to do anything for you because you bring her <b><i>pleasure beyond her wildest dreams</i></b>?</li>
<li>Are you positive that you’re making her go absolutely crazy over you because of the man you are, and what you do for her in the bedroom <i>(or on the kitchen counter), </i>and that she genuinely respects and admires you for it?</li>
<li>Are you truly confident that you’re one of the <b><i>best </i></b>lovers she’s ever had?</li>
</ul>
<p>If not, then there’s a slight chance you have some room to become an <i>even more</i> incredible lover! (and who doesn’t want to be <b><i>ridiculously good </i></b>in bed?).</p>
<p>The following tips go deeper than a few superficial suggestions of where to put place your fingers or what foods make your semen sweet. Learn to apply them to improve your sex life and help you become the amazing lover you want to be!</p>
<h2><b>SEX TIP #1: A WOMAN’S BIGGEST SEX ORGAN IS HER BRAIN </b></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Excite her emotions and mind, and her body will follow.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Turn her on first with her imagination – <i>not her clitoris </i>– then get physical. Women do indeed love incredible, mind-blowing sex. On a higher (advanced) level, it means she’s capable of having (and you giving) orgasms without any physical stimulation whatsoever.</p>
<h5>Tip #1: Talk dirty to her!<b><i> </i></b></h5>
<p><i></i>Send sexy texts, role-play, or write erotic poems. It’s hot, sexy, and it turns her the hell on! (Need proof? Romance novels are the <i>highest selling</i> genre of fiction books, with estimates at over 50%).</p>
<blockquote><p>    <b><i>“Dirty talk is an art.”</i></b></p></blockquote>
<p>Hint at what you plan to do to her in bed. She’ll be thinking all day about how good she’s going to feel when she’s in your arms (<i>or pinned down underneath them</i>) later that night!</p>
<h2><b>SEX TIP #2: TAKE THE LEAD</b></h2>
<blockquote><p><em>    </em><b>“As a man, it’s your job to lead in the bedroom. ”</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Women are more independent now than ever. They are parents, students, and career women &#8211; roles that require them to lead themselves and others. When she is with a man, a woman wants and needs to be able to surrender to him, and be feminine. In other words, she wants <b><i>you </i></b>to take the lead!</p>
<h5>Tip #2: Take the lead.</h5>
<p>Escort her to the bedroom. Take her hand and slide just where you want it. Be adventurous, open, and honest, and she will do the same!</p>
<h2><b>SEX TIP #3: WOMEN ARE DIALS, MEN ARE SWITCHES  </b></h2>
<blockquote><p><b>“Keep building the anticipation until she can’t take it anymore. She’ll go mad!”</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Men are usually ready to get it on at the drop of a dime. Women, on the other hand, need to be <b><i>turned</i></b> on – not simply flipped on like a light switch. Think of the knob that controls the volume of your hi-def audio system &#8211; <i>that’s women</i>. How fast or slow you turn the dial is <b><i>very </i></b>important.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“A great lover knows when the time’s right. He can sense when she’s ready to get things going.”<i> </i></b></p></blockquote>
<h5>Tip #3: Tease her to please her.<b><i> </i></b></h5>
<p>If you’re about to kiss her, go in for the kiss…slowly. Kiss her legs up toward her thighs… almost painstakingly slow. It’ll drive her crazy!</p>
<p>Remember, the anticipation of something is often better than actually getting it &#8211; for men <i>and</i> women. Go too fast and she’ll think you’re a pervert. Go too slow and she’ll think you’re a wussy. A great lover knows when the time’s right, and when she’s ready to get things going!</p>
<h2><b>SEX TIP #4: MAKE HER PLEASURE, YOUR PLEASURE</b></h2>
<blockquote><p><b><i>“</i>So many guys grow up watching porn and think that’s what great sex is.”<i> </i></b></p></blockquote>
<p>Porn is made for <i>men</i> to get off to, and is focused on them – which is the <b>least</b> likely way to get her to orgasm. It’s also a surefire way to become a <i>horrible</i> lover!</p>
<blockquote><p><b>“Play her body like an instrument. Conduct her pleasure like a symphony, making her climax in erotic harmony.”</b></p></blockquote>
<h5>Tip #4: Make her pleasure your priority.</h5>
<p>Replace the “What’s in it for me?” mentality with the “I love seeing her face and hearing her voice when I’m making her feel this good” mentality. Think of new ways to bring her pure bliss and make her climax to new heights!</p>
<h4><b>Focus on her by: </b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Taking off <b><i>her</i></b> clothes first</li>
<li>Bringing her to orgasm <b><i>before</i></b> intercourse</li>
<li>Asking her what <b><i>she </i></b>wants</li>
<li>Exploring positions (and places) <b><i>she</i></b> loves</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>SEX TIP #5: BE PRESENT </b></h2>
<blockquote><p><b>“If you’re in your head, you’ll miss the moment, and you won’t enjoy yourself or her.”</b></p></blockquote>
<h5>Tip #5: Just Let Go and Be.<b><i> </i></b></h5>
<p>If you’re worried about what she’ll say tomorrow or if she’s going to laugh at your “size”, you won’t to be doing her <i>or</i> yourself any good. Remember, if you expect her to follow your lead, you need to be confident. So get out of your head and into your body!</p>
<p>Now go off and have some <b><i>bathroom-sink-breaking, neighbor-waking, back-arching, incredibly remarkable sex! </i></b></p>
<p>The only downside is that you’ll probably totally ruin it for the next guy. Oh well!</p>

<p>The following words have been channeled by a psychic medium and are supposedly coming from an extra-terrestrial species called the Pleiadians &#8230; No, I am not nuts. So don&#8217;t even go there and stay with me.</p>
<p>The message is amazing, powerful &amp; empowering and to me this is all that counts. I don&#8217;t care where it comes from. You might believe in other species alive in this universe or not, but the message hits the current zeitgeist. Read it. Just do it. And do it without any judgement.</p>

<p>In the Pleiades, we have always known and have always taught our children the sacred purpose of <a title="Cervical Orgasm – This Keeps Any Women in Orgasmic Bliss For Hours (Sometimes Even Days) &amp; Is Worth 10 Kingdoms Of Gold" href="http://mytinysecrets.com/cervical-orgasm-this-keeps-any-women-in-orgasmic-bliss-for-hours-sometimes-even-days-is-worth-10-kingdoms-of-gold/">orgasm</a>. This knowledge has been kept from you by the tyrant consciousness that has controlled this plane, third dimensional planet Earth, for the past 6,000 years.</p>
<p>The tyrants found that it was much easier to control your species if they brainwashed you with sexual guilt and suppressed your natural sexuality. The power that flows through your body is the same power that allows the rest of us (yes, you are not alone!) to access the myriad of nested layers of multidimensional realities that exist and have always existed all around you.</p>
<h2>Doctors will tell you that an orgasm is a matter of blood and nerve endings..</h2>
<p>Your scientists and doctors will tell you that an orgasm is a matter of blood and nerve endings. This physical explanation is not even the tip of the iceberg. Your orgasms take place in a realm that remains largely invisible to most of you. When you experience that sweet ephemeral pleasure you call orgasm, something is occurring in the invisible realm which is very powerful.</p>
<p>If you were able to see the waves of energy that pour from your bodies at the moment of orgasm, you would be very careful what you think about when this happens. There are waves upon waves of energy generated by your chakras (energy centers), your endocrine system, and your physical reactions.</p>
<h2>Be very careful what you are thinking</h2>
<p>These waves of energy correlate precisely to your thoughts, meaning your consciousness. As you release these frequencies, an entire package flows out into the invisible realms. This is why it is very important for you to be careful of what you are thinking at this moment.</p>
<p>Those who are foolish enough to tune into dark thoughts, such as pain and bondage, during their sexual experiences will find themselves plugged into a lower plane of consciousness with some very draining companions.</p>
<p>All those wonderfully hideous images painted in the Middle Ages will give you a good idea of the company you can expect to keep.</p>
<h2>Your lust will increase, but it will never really be satisfied</h2>
<p>Not only will you hook yourself up to some very nasty entities, but you will find your sexual experience limited and limiting. Your lust will increase, but it will never really be satisfied. Those lower dimensional forces which you have invited to feed upon your orgasmic display will not want you to move on.</p>
<p>They will always want more from you. This is why pornography, especially the victim style of pornography, has very big cooties! These negative draining parasitical entities can easily be felt even in cyberspace.</p>
<h2>A Sacred Orgasm draws pure souls</h2>
<p>If you want to use your experience to uplift you and your lover, then you both must focus on your mutual consciousness. Your endocrine system works in tandem with your chakras to emit waves of energy. These wave forms have the frequency and even color which correspond precisely with the level of your consciousness from your thoughts. These waves can be seen by those souls who are waiting in the invisible realms for an entry frequency.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>In simple terms, if you want a child when you are in sexual union, your orgasm will attract the level of consciousness you are creating.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>You will attract to you the type of consciousness you are generating. Magnetism is the law of the Invisible Realms: Like attracts like. The child/soul is attracted to a similar consciousness, meaning whatever thoughts you are having while you are making love.</p>
<h2>Your orgasm is an exact expression of your consciousness</h2>
<p>If you are drunk or on drugs, you will attract a soul from those realms. If you are angry or having some dark fantasy, then you will magnetize a soul from those realms. Consciousness is everything, even in the act of love making.</p>
<p>Even if you are not creating a child, you are still sending out masses of energy onto the Earth plane and into the Invisible Realms. This energy greatly effects everything, including the fertility of your fields, the quality of your lives, and what you call Nature. The energies of orgasm can lift the entire planet, if properly done.</p>
<h2>Massive deep sacred orgasmic wave fields</h2>
<p>It is very important to realize the differences between men and women in this matter. In the physical world, the woman is the receptive generator (yin) and the man is the creative instigator (yang).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>If the man wants to enjoy the full and subtle nuances of Sacred Orgasm, he must patiently, sweetly, lovingly, and deliberately lift the frequencies of his lover. The fact is that when a woman generates massive deep sacred orgasmic wave fields, so will her partner. Their union will prolong his orgasm with hers.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>If he allows himself, he will be able to tune into to her experiences, which he himself has fired and augmented. He will be carried away in the Bliss of their mutually created bliss, the cosmic waves of the true sacred orgasm.</p>
<p>You don’t know what you are missing if you are not experiencing this now. Not only that, but in fact the sacred orgasm is your Divine Right. Your beautiful bodies were designed for this in order to attract evolving souls into your plane, third dimensional planet Earth. The reptilian-based tyrants have kept you from this knowledge. They have imprisoned you in guilt and shame; you are ashamed of your bodies which are works of art.</p>
<p>You have no idea what your human bodies are capable of. You are like super computers with no users manual. But you will not be this way forever. The time of the tyrants will come to an end the moment you freely chose to stop giving your power to them. It is up to you.</p>
<p>Have fun! Inanna</p>

<p>C&#8217;mon, share your thoughts with me. Do you think I have gone nuts? Did you find some truth in the message? Do you think this is complete bullsh**?</p>
<p>Love, Adina</p>
